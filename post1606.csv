[S]: Serre Jean-Pierre. Facteurs locaux des fonctions zeta des varietes algebriques (definitions et conjectures) Seminaire Delange-Pisot-Poitou 1969-70

Serre presents nine conjectures C$_1$-C$_9$ concerning Galois representations on $l$-adic cohomology of nonsingular projective algebraic varieties defined over a local or global field. What is the status of those conjectures today? The first two of them are part of the Weil conjectures but how about the rest? What (partial) progress has been made towards their resolution? Let me recall the conjectures below (skipping the first two).

Let $K_v$ be a local field of residue characteristic $p$ let $Y$ be a nonsingular projective variety over $K_v$ and let $m\ge 0$. If $G_v$ is the absolute Galois group of $K_v$ the functoriality of $l$-adic cohomology ($l \neq p$) gives us a representation $\rho_l\colon G_v \rightarrow H^m(\overline{Y} \mathbb{Q}_l) =: V$ (here $\overline{Y}$ is the base change of $Y$ to the separable closure of $K_v$). One can measure how ramified $\rho_l$ is by introducing $\epsilon = \dim V - \dim V^{I_v}$ ($I_v$ is the inertia in $G_v$) and $\delta$ which is a little bit more involved to define (it is the inner product of $\mathrm{Tr }\ \rho_l|_{I_v}$ with the ""Swan character"" of $\rho_l$ see 2.1 in [S]). The conductor exponent of $\rho_l$ is then $f = \epsilon + \delta$.

C$_3$: The integers $\epsilon$ $\delta$ and $f$ are independent of $l$.

Status: ???

C$_4$: $\mathrm{Tr }\ \rho_l|_{I_v}$ takes values in $\mathbb{Z}$ and is independent of $l$.

Status: ???

Consider the geometric Frobenius $\pi \in G_v/I_v$. Then $\rho_l(\pi)$ acts on $V^{I_v}$ and we get a polynomial $P_{\rho_l}(T) = \det(1 - \rho_l(\pi) T)$.

C$_5$: $P_{\rho_l}$ has coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ and is independent of $l$.

Status: ???

Assuming the latter conjecture split $P_{\rho_l}(T) = \prod (1 - \lambda_\alpha T)$ and let $Nv$ denote the cardinality of the residue field of $K_v$.

C$_6$: For each $\alpha$ there is an integer $m(\alpha)$ between $0$ and $m$ such that $|\alpha| = (Nv)^{m(\alpha)/2}$.

Status: ???

C$_7$: If $\epsilon = 0$ (i.e. if $\rho_l$ is unramified) then all $m(\alpha)$ are equal to $m$.

Status: ???

C$_8$: Let $g$ be an element of $G_v$ whose image in $G_v/I_v$ is an integral power of Frobenius. Then the characteristic polynomial of $\rho_l(g)$ has coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ and is independent of $l$.

Status: ???

The last conjecture C$_9$ concerns the zeta function $\zeta(s)$ of a nonsingular projective variety $X$ defined over a global field $K$ (and fixed $m \ge 0$ as above) as well as the completed version $\xi(s)$ of $\zeta(s)$. It's a bit of a trek to define $\zeta(s)$ and $\xi(s)$ so I'll refer to [S] $\S$3 $\S$4 for that. Both $\zeta(s)$ and $\xi(s)$ are holomorphic functions on some right half-plane.

This action defines a standard unitary representation called the permutation representation on the Hilbert space $l_2(X)$ of all functions $X\to \mathbb C$ with finite $l_2$ norm. The Hilbert space have an obvious Hilbert basis consisting of elements $\delta_x$ indexed by $x\in X$ ($\delta_x$ is the function which is 1 on $x$ and 0 everywhere else) and $G$ acts on the basis by permutations.

  When is it possible to deform the permutation representation to some non-conjugate representation of $G$ in $l_2(X)$? 


Here ""non-conjugate"" means that the deformation is not trivially realized by an action of the isometry group of $l_2(X)$. More generally I would like to know if there is a theory of infinitesimal deformations which may produce non-conjugate representations starting from a permutation representation for specific pairs $(G X)$; I suppose that since $G$ is not compact a general answer is unknown but it might be known for specific cases.

I need to know if there is a notion of the product of two categories or what could substitute for this in general. Do you have any references please?

The definition I have in mind is the following:

DEFINITION : Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be two categories. The product category if it exists is a category $\mathcal{C}$ together with two functors $p:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{A}$ $q:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{B}$ such that for all other $(\mathcal{C}'p'q')$ as above there exists a unique functor $\pi:\mathcal{C}'\to\mathcal{C}$ such that $p\circ\pi=p'$ and $q\circ\pi=q'$.

I encounter the following (potential) counter-example to the existence of a product.

$\bullet$ Assume that both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are sets and moreover that one does not have arrows at all i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Hom}(XX')\;=\;\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
\{\mathrm{Id}_X\}&amp;\textrm{ if }&amp;X=X'\\
\emptyset&amp;\textrm{ if }&amp; X\neq X'
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
What should be the product in this case? I think that the product should be the category
whose objects are the elements of the product of sets $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}$ and 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}((XY)(X'Y'))\;=\;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(XX')\times \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(YY')
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ But this does not work! In fact one has 

LEMMA : With this definition $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}((XY)(X'Y'))$ always have exactly a single element. 

PROOF : If $X=X'$ or if $Y=Y'$ one has $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}((XY)(X'Y'))=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(XX')\times \emptyset=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(XX')$ or $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}((XY)(X'Y'))=\emptyset\times \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(YY')=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(XX')$ respectively. Then compose the unique existing arrows $(XY)\to(XY')\to(X'Y')$. $\Box$

Given a node $v\in G_{n}$ we define $T_{n}(v)$ as the total flow generated in $G_{n}$ passing through $v$. In other words $T_{n}(v)$ is the sum off all the geodesic paths in $G_{n}$ which are carrying flow and contain the node $v$. Let $M_{n}$ be the maximum flow

Another problem is to find all maximal atlases for which a given function on $M$ or other object for example a tensor is smooth.

Update: I don't ask about exotic smooth structures. The compatibility of atlases is ""finer"" but both are named ""smooth structures"" which leads to confusions (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_structure#Confusion_about_terminology).

Now let's consider the set $N$ containing only the origin. When we restrict the charts from $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal A'$ to $M-N$ we obtain two compatible atlases although $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal A'$ are not compatible. This justifies the first problem:

88741,"Given a hyperbolic PDE the domain of influence of a spacetime point $x$ say $I_x$ though $x$ could be replaced by any set can be defined in two ways. Lets call one of them geometric ($I_x^G$) and the other analytical ($I_x^A$). In Lorentzian geometry the geometric domain of influence consists of the interior of the cone of null geodesics emanating from $x$ (let me not bother about whether to include the boundary in the definition of $I_x^G$ or not). In general a similar definition can be given using characteristic cones instead of null cones. The analytical domain of influence can be defined as the set of all spacetime points $y$ such that for every neighborhood neighborhood $O$ of $x$ there exist two solutions $u_1$ and $u_2$ satisfying the condition $u_1(x')=u_2(x')$ for all $x'$ on a Cauchy surface passing through $x$ except for $x'\in O$ and also the condition $u_1(y)\ne u_2(y)$. The latter one is the definition used in Lax's book on Hyperbolic PDEs.

Similar defintions can be given for the geometric and analytical domain of dependence say $D_S^G$ and $D_S^A$. Such a definition should capture the desired equality $D_K = I_{S\setminus K}$ for a Cauchy surface $S$ and $K\subset S$ (once again being sloppy with boundaries). I know that energy methods can be used to establish that $D^G_K \subseteq D^A_K$ (the analytical domain of dependence is at least as large as the geometric one). Hence by duality the same methods establish $I_K^A \subseteq I_K^G$ (that the geometric domain of influence is at least as large as the analytical one).

My question is about the reverse inclusion $I_K^G \subseteq I_K^A$ or by duality $D_K^A \subseteq D_K^G$. Maybe it's too much to ask for the analytical and geometric definitions to coincide. But when they do what methods are used to establish that? When they don't what methods can identify the obstruction? Except briefly in Lax's book I don't know what references discuss this problem explicitly so those would also be appreciated!

1) Finite set case: functions from $\lbrace 12\cdotsn\rbrace$ to itself is one-one iff onto.

2) Linear operators $T:V\rightarrow V$ where $V$ is finite dimensional vector space is also one-one iff onto.

3) Linear operators of the from (I-K) where K is some compact operator acting on a Banach space satisfies this property. This is the famous result of Fredholm. 

It is very easy to find domains where the result fails.

88758,"Definition: Let $\kappa$ be an $\aleph$ cardinal we say that $\langle f_\alpha\colon\alpha\to\kappa\mid\alpha&lt;\kappa^+\rangle$ is a ladder if every $f_\alpha$ is injective.

Equivalently this is the range of a choice function from every injection of $\alpha$ into $|\alpha|$ (for $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ we can always assume the identity is taken). Such ladder implies automatically that $\kappa^+$ is regular since the union of $\kappa$ enumerated sets of size $\kappa$ is at most of size $\kappa$. (Recall that for well ordered sets $\kappa\times\kappa=\kappa$ even without the axiom of choice)

For example then if $\omega_1$ is singular then there is no such ladder of countable ordinals since this would imply that $\aleph_1=\aleph_0^+$ is regular therefore the existence of ladders for every successor ordinal is not provable in ZF alone.

However if we assume the existence of an inaccessible cardinal we can have the situation where $\aleph_1$ is indeed regular but there is no ladder avail. Indeed this is a necessary requirement since in such situation $\omega_1$ is inaccessible in $L$.

Both the forcing which makes $\aleph_1$ singular and the one which makes it regular without a ladder are essentially the same: collapse a limit cardinal to $\aleph_1$ and take symmetry model which ensures that no ladder exists while setting $\aleph_1$ to have the cofinality of collapsed cardinal i.e. singular or regular (if it was inaccessible).

Question I: Can we do this trick by replacing $\aleph_1$ by $\aleph_\alpha$ for any non-limit ordinal? So for example $\aleph_5$ would be singular or regular without a ladder.

Question II: We do not need an inaccessible cardinal to have $\omega_1$ singular nor $\omega_2$ singular. However if we want them both to be singular it already implies $0^\#$ exists and requires Woodin cardinals.

Suppose $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ are both regular and neither has a ladder. Can we do that ""just"" from the existence of two inaccessible cardinals or would such phenomenon imply that some very large cardinals are playing in the background?

88777,"Let $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ be an integer with $k$ prime factors. We know that the number of integers less than $n$ and coprime to it is
 $$\Phi(n)=n-\sum_i\frac n{p_i}+\sum_{i \lt j}\frac n{p_ip_j}-\cdots+(-1)^{k}\frac n{n}=nr$$ where $r=\prod(1-\frac 1{p_i})$.

For any positive integer $x$ the number  of integers less than or equal to $x$ and relatively prime to $n$  is given exactly by the alternating sum $$\Phi(nx)=x-\sum_i\lfloor{x/{p_i}}\rfloor+\sum_{i \lt j}\lfloor x/{p_ip_j}\rfloor-\cdots+(-1)^{k}\lfloor x/{n}\rfloor$$


  How large and how small can the error $\Phi(nx)-xr$ be? Can the absolute value of the error exceed $k$?


Certainly the error can be no more (in absolute value) than $2^k$ probably it is easy to show that it could not be more than the middle binomial coefficient $\binom k{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor}$. I can see that it could get (almost) as large as $ k $ by imitating the following example: 

The integers $1122659 2245319 4490639 8981279 17962559 35925119 71850239$ are a Cunningham chain as is $25112347$ in that each member is prime and one more than twice the previous one. If $n$ is the product of the $7$ primes from the first chain and $x=1122659\cdot64-1=71850175$ then all seven terms $  x/{p_i} $ are just a bit less than an integer so without the rounding down to an integer the estimate $rx$ will too small by about $7$ (the other terms are quite small). Of course it is not known for sure that there are arbitrary length chains. Maybe a similar idea could get an error of order $2k$ or $k^2.$

Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$. Define

$$N(k) = C_n Vol(M) k^n + O(k^{n-1})$$
for some explicit constant C_n depending only on n.
Now suppose $M$ is a smooth complex projective subvariety of complex dimension d in ${\mathbb C}P^r$ equipped with the Fubini-Study metric from projective space. 
Hilbert's theorem states that the Hilbert function $H(k)$ of $M$ has asymptotic 
$$H(k) = (1/d!)Vol(M) k^d + O(k^{d-1})$$ where $Vol(M)$ is the volume of $M$ with respect to 
Fubini-Study metric which in turn is equal to degree of M as a subvariety of projective space. 
Noting that $2d$ is real dimension of $M$ the two functions $H(k^2)$ and $N(k)$ have very similar asymptotic (given by dimension and volume).

88799,"This question is pretty simple to state: given two linear functions on a polygon I'm looking for a formula for the integral of their product which depends only on the values at the (unlabelled) edges and on the shape of the polygon. However the motivation comes from a problem I've been investigating for a while so I thought I might as well elaborate for the sake of context (the previous question in the series is here). My understanding of the problem is gradually progressing and with it the way in which I formulate it. Quick recap:

I'm interested in variations of piecewise linear surfaces in â3 (which need not be triangulated). Fixing the ""combinatorial type"" of a surface - i.e. the way vertices edges and faces are joined together - I have found that the space of variations has dimension E + 3Ï with E the number of edges and Ï the Euler characteristic. For surfaces homeomorphic to a sphere we get E+6 with 6 dimensions corresponding to translations and rotations.

I would like to find an inner product on the space of variations with the following caveat. There are operations which change the combinatorial structure of a surface but not its actual shape - such as adding a ""flat"" edge across a non-triangular face or an edge of zero length at a vertex where more than three faces meet. In such cases there is a natural inclusion of the variations of the original surface into the variations of the new one and I would like my inner product to be preserved under this inclusion.

I've been proceeding by analogy with the smooth case: each variation induces a unique normal vector field on every face so we can take the pointwise product of these and then integrate. This inner product is intuitively consistent in the sense described in the previous paragraph.

Because variations must preserve linearity of the faces the vector fields are linear on each face - so we can write them and their product in terms of the vertices or edges. In particular for a triangular face the inner product is the average of the (pointwise) products on the centres of the edges multiplied by the area of the face.

This is promising: for triangulated surfaces I now have an expression which depends only on the edges. But I'm having trouble extending this to non-triangular faces. I've tried triangulating a polygon in various specific and generic ways and so far all I've got is a mess. But maybe I'm being stupid. Any suggestions?

I'm not sure if it's even possible for general first order logic statements so let's restrict ourselves to propositional statements. Assume for simplicity that we know if the statement in question is true or false beforehand.

Then if one is using the DPLL system for proving a propositional statement false (or true after taking the negation of the statement and trying to prove the unsatisfiability of that) then one can easily define a measure of progress towards the proof - if the statement has $n$ variables and we encounter failure after branching on $k$ variables then we have made $2^{-k}$ fraction progress towards a proof of unsatisfiability.

If one works with the resolution proof system then I can't think of a polynomial-time computable measure. For an exponential-time measure one could examine all clauses derived so far and calculate what fraction of the search space they prune.

For more general proof systems which allow introducing new variables however (like the Extended Frege system for instance) I can't think of any measure. (Edit: except in a very limited sense in which we explore the space of all possible proofs and then decide whether a particular step counted as progress towards a proof of unsat)

So my question is whether there exist better measures of progress towards a proof of unsatisfiability (or tautology) of a propositional formula than the ones above.

A relevant link might be this which talks about defining a measure of progress in terms of computing a function in terms of proving lower bounds. If we take the function to output 0 if the input formula is unsat and 1 if it is not then it could be relevant to the measure in question above.

88842,"I think the statement of the question is pretty straightforward.  Given a finite $n$-dimensional CW complex are there necessary and sufficient conditions for determining that it is also a compact $n$-dimensional topological manifold (possibly with boundary)?  Most of the questions I have found are about the converse ""When is a topological manifold a CW-complex?"" so I thought it would be useful to consider the other side of the picture.

First of all we already have 2nd countable and Hausdorff so we only need to determine when it is locally Euclidean.  One necessary condition is that every point must be contained in the closure of at least one $n$-cell.  One the other hand a point can't be in too many $n$-cells as the wedge of spheres is not a manifold.  But these criteria are clearly not sufficient (or very precise: what does ""too many"" mean exactly?).

Another necessary condition that I think of right away is that the space must satisfy Poincare duality (with $\mathbb{Z}/2$ coefficients).  I'm not sure if this is practical at all but maybe it is useful if you are working with an explicit cell-structure and a concrete description of the cellular chain complex.

After that I don't know how to proceed.  I am assuming this is a difficult problem since Google searches haven't answered my question yet.  One idea that I have is to try and come up with an ""obstruction"" to this where cell-by-cell we determine if every point in that cell admits an $n$-dimensional Euclidean nhd and we have that the CW-complex is a manifold iff this ""obstruction"" computed at the homology/cohomology level vanishes.

Question is about ""channel capacity"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity I guess it is pretty elementary for experts however I have not seen it discussed in e.g. Proakis book or Tse ""Fundamentals of Wireless Com"".

Question (roughly speaking): is channel capacity known for the fading channel with ""pilots"" ? (discrete memoryless channel). ""Pilots"" - means we transmit on certain positions symbols known to receiver and transmitter both. It is common for all modern telecommunication standards GSM UMTS LTE to have ""pilots"".



Simplest example:

Consider the following signal model (""block"" fading) block length $N$ pilot number $k$

$r_{il} = h_l s_{il} + n_{il}$

here $i=1...N$ - index of symbol inside block $N$ - block length
$l=1...infinity$ - index of block

$h_l$ - are  random i.i.d but constant on block i.e. does not depend on ""i"" 

$s_{il}$ sent symbols assume that for $i=1...k$ and all $l$ they are pilots i.e. they are equal to $1$. For other $i$ these sent information signals - assume also i.i.d.

$n_{il}$ - noise - random i.i.d. 

What is the capacity of this channel ?
Assume that distributions of all random variables are given - for simplicity can assume they are Gaussian.

For plane algebraic curves this is not too hard.

with $F(00) = 0$
one can formally expand $y$ as a Puiseux series in $x$
$$
y(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty y_i x^{\alpha_i}
$$
The Puiseux theorem actually states that such a series converges (in some sense) near $x=0$.
Alternatively we can construct Riemann surface over the point $(00)\in \mathbb{C}^2$ of the algebraic function $y(x)$ which has the normal representation as holomorphic element

x &amp;=&amp; t^m \cr
y &amp;=&amp; \sum_{i=1}^\infty y_i t^i

with $F(0\ldots0) = (0\ldots0)$

if we fix a place of the this algebraic curve centred at $(0\ldots0)$
we should be able to find a parametrization

The problem is there seem to be varying definitions of the exponential in the surreal numbers and since I can't find any recent reference that covers them all I have little idea whether they're actually the same or not.  (When I say ""exponential"" I mean either $e^x$ or the general $a^x$ for $a>0$; obviously one can go back and forth between these so long as $e^x$ is indeed a bijection from surreals to positive surreals.)

To wit:


Harry Gonshor gives one definition in his ""An Introduction to the Theory of Surreal Numbers"".
Gonshor mentions an earlier unpublished definition due to Martin Kruskal; so does Conway in the 2nd edition of ""On Numbers and Games"". Neither actually state this definition but it is strictly speaking possible for someone who's never seen it to verify equivalence with it because Conway mentions that it is inverse to a particular definition of the logarithm which he does not explicitly state but gives enough information to deduce.  Gonshor seems to suggest in his text that his definition is equivalent to Kruskal's unpublished one but on the other hand never seems to explicitly state so.
Norman Alling's ""Foundations of Analysis over Surreal Number Fields"" looks like it might contain another definition?  I'm not too clear on what he's doing honestly though it looks like it's restricted to non-infinite surreals...
Wikipedia's page gives a totally uncited definition for $2^x$.  I have no idea where this might be originally from.  I suppose one could substitute in other surreals for 2 to generalize this?
Or else one could take Wikipedia's definition and generalize it in the way one usually does when starting from $e^x$? (I should hope this agrees with definition 4!).


Note that the operation $x\mapsto \omega^x$ commonly used in the surreals is not related; though it's exponential in some sense it's not surjective onto the positive surreals and so definitions of a general exponential shouldn't attempt to agree with it. And of course definitions 1 2 and 4/5 above are surjective onto the positive surreals.  (Or Wikipedia claims #4/5 is anyway.)

Edit: To avoid confusion in what follows I'll write $\exp_\omega x$ instead of the usual $\omega^x$ and reserve the notation $\omega^x$ for whatever that happens to be in the notion of exponentiation under discussion.

So does anyone know to what extent these are actually equivalent?  If they're not equivalent is there agreement on which ones are the ""right"" definitions?  (It seems like all of them have the right properties!  And while it seems to be agreed that the idea behind Kruskal's definition is bad that doesn't mean necessarily the definition itself is.)  Or could anyone point me to any recent book which might clear all this up or at least the source of Wikipedia's definition?

(I had originally intended to ask other questions about surreal exponentiation before finding that I wasn't sure what it actually was.  I am hoping that whatever references people can point me to will answer my other questions as well.)

Slight update: Definitions 4 doesn't seem to agree with definition 5 (nor definition 1 see below); it would seem that definition 4 would imply $3^\omega=\omega$ while definition 5 would imply $3^\omega>\omega$.  This raises the problem in that one could make more definitions by using definition 4 to define $a^x$ for some fixed $a$ and then generalizing it to $b^x$ for all $b$ via definition 5 and depending on your choice of starting $a$ -- whether $e$ 2 or something else -- you'd get different definitions of $b^x$ out.  An entire proper class of distinct ""exponentiation"" operations!  Well perhaps not perhaps not all starting values of $a>1$ yield an onto function -- perhaps 2 is special and it's the only one that does though that seems pretty unlikely and barring that this is pretty bad regardless.  Also definition 4 seems pretty suspect as the ""right"" definition for another reason: If we plug in two ordinals it looks like it will agree with ordinary ordinal exponentiation.  This both disagees with Gonshor's definition (which would imply $\omega^\omega>\exp_\omega \omega$) and is suspect on its own because we shouldn't expect to get one of the ordinary ordinal operations out of this (we use natural addition and multiplication in the surreals not ordinary addition and multiplication).  If indeed we get an ordinal operation out of this at all -- it would appear that by Gonshor's definition $\omega^\omega$ would not even be an ordinal instead being equal to $\exp_\omega \exp_\omega (1+1/\omega)$.

Oops: Sorry that shouldn't be ordinary exponentiation but rather the analogue of it based on natural multiplication.  Regardless still disagrees still smells bad.

88929,"I have a question concering the family of Pellian equations 
     $$x^2 - (k^2+1)y^2 = k^2.  \qquad    (*)$$   

For an integer $k\geq 2$ the equation (*) has at least three classes of solutions 
in integers corresponding to the fundamental solutions 
$(x_0y_0) = (k 0)$ $(k^2-k+1 k-1)$ $(k^2-k+1 -(k-1))$. 
Each fundamental solution induces a sequence (class) of solutions by 
$$ x+\sqrt{k^2+1}y = (x_0+\sqrt{k^2+1}y_0)(k+\sqrt{k^2+1})^{2m}. $$ 

For certain values of $k$ there are two additional classes 
of solutions. E.g. for $k=2t^2$ we have also fundamental 
solutions $(x_0y_0) = (2t^3+t \pm t)$ and additional 
solutions occur also for $k=4s^3-4s^2+3s-1$ 
for $k=F_{2n}$ and other polynomial or exponential subfamilies. 
However I am not able to find any example such that (*) 
has more than five classes of solutions. 

So I am wondering does it make sense to state the conjecture 
that for $k\geq 2$ equation (*) always have 
exactly three or five classes of solutions 
(e.g. 3 or 5 fundamental solutions). 
Is there an obvious reason why should (or should not) 
the number of fundamental solutions of (*) be bounded 
by an absolute constant (independent on $k$)? 

It is easy to see that each fundamental solution $(x_0y_0)$ 
has to satisfy $|y_0| &lt; k$ so the conjecture actually says 
that there is at most one solution of equation (*) with 
$0 &lt; y &lt; k-1$. 

This question is related to the conjecture which 
says that there does not exist a set of four 
positive integer with the property that the 
product of any two of them is 1 greater than a square 
(see e.g. Section 3.1 of Diophantine m-tuples page
and references given there).

This follows since if $(0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots \subset \widehat{V_k} \subset \cdots \subset V_{2n}=V) \in \pi_k^{-1}(z_n)$ it is stabilized by $z_n$ then $z_n V_{k+1}=V_{k-1}$ since $\text{ker}(z_n)$ is $2$-dimensional; and we can map this flag to $(0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots \subset V_{k-1}=z_n V_{k+1} \subset \cdots \subset z_n V_{2n}) \in \pi^{-1}(z_{n-1})$. A similar argument may be made when we replace $z_n$ by a nilpotent $x \in S_n \cap \text{im}(\pi_k)$ showing that $\pi_k^{-1}(x) \simeq \pi^{-1}(x|_{xV})$ but then the vector space $xV$ is not a fixed vector space and I am having trouble patching up the isomorphism.

I hope it's ok for me to post this question here (maybe it's better to ask the author of the paper but I wasn't able to contact the author in this case.)

88996,"Not every complex manifold is a KÃ¤hler manifold (i.e. a manifold which can be equipped with a KÃ¤hler metric). All Riemann surfaces are KÃ¤hler but in dimension two and above at least for compact manifolds there is a necessary topological condition (i.e. the odd Betti numbers are even). This condition is also sufficient in dimension two but not in higher dimensions. Therefore the task of finding examples of compact complex manifolds which are not KÃ¤hler is reduced to topological considerations. 

In the non-compact setting we can also find such manifolds. For example let $H$ be a Hopf surface which is a compact complex surface which is not KÃ¤hler. Then for $k > 0$ $M_{k+2} = H\times\mathbb{C}^k$ is a non-compact complex manifold which is not KÃ¤hler - any submanifold of a KÃ¤hler manifold is KÃ¤hler and $H$ is a submanifold of $M_{k+2}$. This generates examples in dimensions three and above. So I ask the following question:

Communication background

Consider transmission of sequence of signals (bits) i1 i2 i3... which are integers.
Assume that during the transmission signals are distorted:  $k$-th received signals is 
obtained as $r(k)=h_0 i_k+ h_1i_{k-1}+...h_{l}i_{k-l} + random_{k}$.

The part $h_0 i_k+ h_1i_{k-1}+...h_{l}i_{k-l}$ is called ISI (inter-symbol interference).
(Here $i_m$ - ""sent symbols"").

$+ random_{k}$ - noise distorting symbol e.g. thermal noise. So we can right in matrix-vector form: $R=HI+noise$ where $H$ will be $l$-diagonal Toeplitz matrix. 

The task of the ""receiver""  having $R$ and $H$ -- to find $I$ (e.g. from received signal find sent signal).
Under assumption of Gassian distrubution for noise one can easily come that maximum likelihood answer for $I$ will be such an integer vector that $I=argmin|R-HI|^2$.



Origin of ISI  (inter-symbol interference) can be ""multi-path"" propagation which appears due to multiple reflections of the radio wave. ""Reflected waves"" come later - so we get mixture of signals.

Here is where i got stuck i was hoping for a direct proof starting with the LHS of $\sum \cos p\theta = 0$.

Solution attempt

Well as we know the number of primitive roots(roots the power of which give all the roots) is the number of integers(including unity) less than n and prime to it. Hence we get this number from Euler's totient or phi function.

In the first part of the problem we are asked to assume $0 &lt; p &lt; \dfrac {n} {abc\ldots k}$.

So applying Taylor's series expansion to LHS we get
$\sum _{i=1}^{i=\varphi \left( n\right) }\cos p\theta _{i} = \sum _{i=1}^{i=\varphi \left( n\right) }\left( 1-\dfrac {\left( p\theta _{i}\right) ^{2}} {2!}+\dfrac {\left( p\theta _{i}\right) ^{4}} {4!}-...\right) $

Combining terms from various expansions we get 
$\sum _{i=1}^{i=\varphi \left( n\right) }\cos p\theta _{i} = \varphi \left( n\right) -\dfrac {p^{2}} {2!}\sum _{i=1}^{i=\varphi \left( n\right) }\theta _{i}^{2} + \dfrac {p^{4}} {24}\sum _{i=1}^{i=\varphi \left( n\right) }\theta _{i}^{4} - ...$

I would like to know some simple sufficient conditions for when the set of numbers integrally represented by a positive four-variable quadratic form is completely multiplicative with
$$ h(xyzw) = f(xy) + B g(zw)   $$
while $fg$ are positive primitive binary quadratic forms of the same discriminant and integer $B \geq 1.$
The only example I am completely sure about is
$$ h(xyzw) = x^2 + A y^2 + B z^2 + A B w^2.   $$
The reason this one is easy is that we can construct quaternions 
$$ x + y i \sqrt A + z j \sqrt B + w k \sqrt {A B}    $$
so the quadratic form is the norm and multiplication is built in. In particular taking $B=1$ we have the principal form repeated.

Noam Elkies pointed out that the condition of complete multiplicativity does not hold for repeated binary $3 x^2 + 7 y^2$ as
$$ h(xyzw) = 3 x^2 + 7 y^2 + 3 z^2 + 7 w^2$$ represents $3$ and $7$ but not $21.$ 

I had this feeling that the fact the $3 x^2 + 2 x y + 4 y^2$ was in a discriminant of one genus and class number three would suffice for the form in question 88905. By itself the binary form represents a completely multiplicative set as its cube  in the class group is the identity but its square is simply its own opposite class. But I am not entirely sure about the quaternary in question 88905. Furthermore I am getting other examples class number five and so on. 

So that is the question simple sufficient conditions for complete multiplicativity of integers represented by 
$$ h(xyzw) = f(xy) + B g(zw).$$

EDIT 2:56 pm: Note that the numbers represented by this $f(xy) + B g(zw)$ can always be multiplied by any number represented by the principal form of the same discriminant as this holds true separately for $fg.$   For this reason if the form in question 88905 is completely muliplicative (as seems very likely) it suffices to consider primes $p \neq 211$ along with $2p$ for  $p \neq 211.$ Noam has already done such the first case. 

EDIT TOOOO 5:06 pm: Noam says that in question 88905 his answer extends to show that the set of numbers represented is indeed multiplicative but he does not expect there to be a direct proof of that. So one might say that I am asking for situations where there is a direct proof. For example there are plenty of forms in four variables that represent all positive integers (if they are integer-matrix they just need to represent the numbers up to 15 if not integer matrix then we need them to represent up to 290 to be sure). Anyway a positive form that represents all numbers integrally is ""completely multiplicative"" in the way I define it but that does not mean there is any nicer proof. 

EDIT THREE 9:18 pm: I have been running examples. Another counterexample is repeating the binary $3 x^2 + x y + 3 y^2$ of discriminant $-35$ the quaternary represents $37$ but not $21.$ However the class number of the principal genus does not seem to matter. So a reasonable revised question is how about when both $fg$ are in the principal genus? NO not good enough same results with $3 x^2 + 3x y + 4 y^2$ of discriminant $-39$ principal genus.

I have no idea what is going on. Many of these clearly work some just don't. If they fail it seems to be with very small numbers.

89069,"As every MO user knows and can easily prove the inverse of the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}$ is $\frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a \end{pmatrix}$. This can be proved for example by writing the inverse as $ \begin{pmatrix} r &amp; s \\ t &amp; u \end{pmatrix}$ and solving the resulting system of four equations in four variables.

As a grad student when studying the theory of modular forms I repeatedly forgot this formula (do you switch the $a$ and $d$ and invert the sign of $b$ and $c$... or was it the other way around?) and continually had to rederive it. Much later it occurred to me that it was better to remember the formula was obvious in a couple of special cases such as $\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and diagonal matrices for which the geometric intuition is simple. One can also remember this as a special case of the adjugate matrix.

Is there some way to just write down $\frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a \end{pmatrix}$ even in the case where $ad - bc = 1$ by pure thought -- without having to compute?

Consider a family of varieties $X_{k}$ $k\in\mathfrak{k}$ defined as follows (I don't know who introduced this first. I learned this from Vogan's article ; it's also studied in many other places. )


  $X_k=G\times^P (\mathfrak{n}+k)$. 


It's known that


For generic $k$ $X_k$ is just the orbit $G\cdot k$ and 
the central fiber is $X_0=T^*(G/P)$. 
Let $Y_0$=Spec of the ring of functions of $X_0$ $Y_0$ is the closure of a ""finite cover"" of a Richardson nilpotent orbit $O=\mathrm{Ind}^{\mathfrak{g}}_{\mathfrak{l}} 0$. 


The examples Vogan talks about is $G=Sp(4)$ with $P$ and $P'$ such that the corresponding Levi subgroups are $L=GL(2)$ and $L'=GL(1)\times Sp(2)$. Construct $Y_0$ and $Y'_0$ accordingly. Vogan says that $Y_0$ is the closure of the nilpotent orbit $O$ of Jordan type (22) and $Y'_0$ is the closure of a double cover of $O$.

My question is as follows: In these examples both $\mathfrak{k}$ and $\mathfrak{k}'$ are one-dimensional so denote elements in them $t\alpha$ $t\alpha'$ respectively ($t\in\mathbb{C}$; $\alpha$ $\alpha'$ the basis of $\mathfrak{k}$ and $\mathfrak{k'}$).  For simplicity let's just consider the latter. Then there is an  $I'_t$ of $A=S(\mathfrak{g})$ such that 


  $X'_{t\alpha'}=\mathrm{Spec} A/I'_t$ 


as long as $t\neq 0$. Now suppose we take the ""limit of $I'_t$ when $t\to 0$"" in a suitable sense. (Write down the generators and let $t\to 0$ for example.) Denote the limits by  $J'$ respectively. Then consider 


  $Z_0'=\mathrm{Spec} A/J'$.


What's the relation between $Z_0'$ $Y_0'$ and $Y_0$ above? For example do the $G$-module structure on the ring of functions of $Z_0'$ and that of $Y_0'$ agree? (If I'm not mistaken there's a natural filtration on the ring of functions on a coadjoint orbit so it makes sense to talk about the $G$-module structure of the finite dimensional subspace whose degree is smaller than a given number; I don't think it can ""jump"" as you vary $t$...)



(Originally I also asked the following question: Vogan says the ring of functions $Y'_0$ as $Sp(4)$ module has a five-dimensional irreducible component while that of $Y_0$ doesn't. I'd like to see how it works. I asked a local mathematician here; he answered me that the number of times an irrep $V$ appears in the function ring of $T^*(G/P)$ is given by $\mathrm{dim} V^P$ due to a classic theorem (which I need to understand later). It's then easy to check that indeed the five-dimensional irrep only appears in the function ring of $Y_0'$ not in that of $Y_0$.)

Thank you!



Edit: the relation between the metric $g$ and the hyperbolic splitting $TM=E^s\oplus E^u$.

The Riemannian metric $g$ induces a norm $\|\cdot\|_x$ on each tangent space $T_xM$ by $\|v\|^2_x=g_x(vv)$ for every $v\in T_xM$. 

The map $f:M\to M$ is said to be hyperbolic  if there exists a continuous splitting $TM=E^s\oplus E^u$ such that 


the splitting is $Df$-invariant: $D_xf(E^s_x)=E^s_{fx}$ and $D_xf(E^u_x)=E^u_{fx}$
$E^s$ is uniformly contracting: $\|D_xf^n(v)\|_{f^nx}\le C\lambda^n_s\|v\|_x$ for every $v\in E^s_x$
$E^u$ is uniformly expanding: $\|D_xf^n(v)\|_{f^nx}\ge C^{-1}\lambda^n_u\|v\|_x$ for every $v\in E^u_x$


for some uniform constant $C\ge1$ and $0&lt;\lambda_s&lt;1&lt;\lambda_u$.

So the hyperbolicity of the map $f$ does depend on the choice of Riemannian metric.

But being hyperbolic is not sensitive to the choice of metric. For example if $f$ is hyperbolic with respect to $(Mg)$ and we have another Riemannian metric $h$ with $C_1\cdot g_x(vv)\le h_x(vv)\le C_2\cdot g_x(vv)$ then $f$ is also hyperbolic with respect to $(Mh)$ (with a possible different $C$).

The upper bound of the curvatures of stable and unstable manifolds (if exists) may depend on the choice of metrics. But the property of having bounded curvature should be independent of the choice of metrics.

A cocycle in $Z^1(GA)$ is a map from G to A  $ s \mapsto a_s $ which is continuous and such that $a_{st} = a_s \ ^s a_t$ for all $st \in G$. Cocycle $ab$ are cohomologous if there is $c \in A$ such that $b=c^{-1} a_s \ ^s c$. The set of these classes of cocycles is $H^1(GA)$.

After these prequisties I present the question. A theorem says that:


  Let  A be a G-group. There is a bijection between the set of classes of principal homogeneous over A (which we denote $P(A)$ and the set $H^1(GS)$.


Serre's proof is as follows he defines a map $\lambda : P(A) \to H^1(GA)$ in the following way:
For $P \in P(A)$ choose $x \in P$. If $s \in G$ then $^sx \in P$ and therefore there exists $a_s \in A$ such that $^sx = x \bullet a_s$. The map $s \mapsto a_s$ defined by choosing this x defines a cocycle and one can check that by substituing $x \bullet b$ one get a cohomologeous cycle and thus $\lambda (P)$ is defined as the class of $a_s$. 

The following isn't clear to me:
Now we want to do the opposite define a map $\mu : H^1(GA) \to P(A)$.
If $a_s \in Z^1(GA)$ one denotes by $P_a$ the group A on which G acts by the following ""twisted"" formula: $x \star s =?= ^{s}'x = a_s \cdot ^sx$. A is given how then we can build another group and call it A? I think that the formula defines a new action of G on $P_a$ (which I don't understand what is it and where it lies I think but not sure that $P_a \subset A$).
Then he says that if we let A act on the right on $P_a$ by translation - I don't to what action he means - then one obtain a principal homogeneous space (need to prove that). Then $\mu$ will map $a_s$ to this space and cohomologeous cocycles to isomorphic spaces.

The final part of the proof is to check that $\lambda \circ \mu = id$ and $\mu \circ \lambda = id$.

I've identified (and hopefully exhausted) the following isometries that will 'fix' a line $l$ set-wise. For the point-wise case clearly only the identity transformation will work.


The identity transformation
Rotation about a point on the line by $\pi$ radians i.e. $R_{c\pi}$ for any point $c$ on the line $l$. I think this can also be expressed as $R_{c\pi}=T_cR_{\pi}T_{-c}$

Reflection about $l$ itself i.e. $F_{\alphau}$ for any $\alpha$ lying on $l$ $u$ perpendicular to $l$
Reflection about any line perpendicular to $l$ i.e. $F_{\beta v}$ for any $\beta$ in the plane with $v$ parallel to $l$

Is there a better way of responding than just listing the isometries as I have done here? i.e. Can we notate the set of the required isomteries more neatly?

  How can I express reflections of the form $F_{\gammaw}$ for some point $\gamma$ and some vector $w$ in the plane in terms of translations by some vector rotations about some point and reflections about the $e_1$ axis?

The optimal solution $x=\min(ab)$ is straightforward and independent of $\alpha\beta$.

$$
A\preceq B\Leftrightarrow A-B\preceq0

where $A\preceq0$ means $A$ is negative semi-definite.

Then the problem above is reformulated as following with matrix variables.

Since $\Lambda$ and $\Theta$ are diagonal matrices the problem can decompose to sum of some scalar variables and solved independently.

   Please consider this object:  Start with a realization of Brownian motion in 2D which I'll denote by rho(t) where -infinity &lt; t &lt;  +infinity.  Next lets smooth rho. There are various ways of doing this. To save space I'll leave it to your imagination.   But the point is that at short length scales the smoothed rho looks like a smooth continuous curve but as you zoom out it looks more and more like the original Brownian path. By the way in the process of smoothing rho  I think the original time parameter is effectively lost.     

So I claim two things. 

1) You can find a circle C such that the smoothed rho never enters inside C.

2) Let us invert the smoothed rho about the circle C so that it now lies entirely within C. I claim that everywhere inside C the smoothed and inverted rho will have dimension 1 except at the center of C  where it has a point fractal dimension of 2.

Thanks to Suvrit for your suggestion! Your comment provides a good way to think about this problem. However I thought about your method but the problem seems to be more complicated than expected.

\mathrm{s.t.}&amp;&amp;X\in\mathcal{C}(A_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_2)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3)
\end{eqnarray}
by first solve $\min_{X_1\in\mathcal{C}(A_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_2)} f(X_1)$ and then $\min_{X_2\in\mathcal{C}(X_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3)}f(X_2)$ the solution in deed satisfies the constraints due to
$$\mathcal{C}(X_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3)\subseteq\mathcal{C}(A_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_2)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3).$$
However these two sets are not identical and thus the optimal solution in $\mathcal{C}(X_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3)$ is not guaranteed to be also optimal in $\mathcal{C}(A_1)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_2)\cap\mathcal{C}(A_3)$.

I think the difficulty of this problem results from the complex structure of the intersections of cones $\bigcap_i\mathcal{C}(A_i)$. Do you have some more suggestions about this problem?

Proof. We will show that $0\neq \phi^\ast\colon\thinspace H^n(\Gamma;\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)\to H^n(G;\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)$. This follows from the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Since the action of $\Gamma$ on $A$ is trivial and $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma$ is a trivial $A$-module the $E_2$ term has
$$H^p(\Gamma;H^q(A;\mathbb{Z}\Gamma))\cong H^p(\Gamma;H^q(A)\otimes\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)$$
in the $(pq)$-position. Since $\Gamma$ is a duality group this is zero for $p\neq n$. Hence there are no non-trivial differentials and the edge homomorphism
$$\phi^\ast\colon\thinspace H^n(\Gamma;\mathbb{Z}\Gamma) \to H^n(G;\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)$$

  Is the classification of the irreducible dual of $GL(nF)$ known only modulo the representation theory $GL(n o)$ or do we know all the representations of $GL(no)$ needed for the dual of $GL(nF)$?


If the description of the dual of $GL(nF)$ is possible independently of the dual of $GL_n(o)$ there is a natural last question in the context of Silberger ""$PGL_2$ over the $p$ adics"" where he classifies the irreducibe of $PGL_2(o)$ via the restricting the irreducible of $PGL_2(F)$.


  Can we classify the representation of $GL_n(o)$ by restricting the irreducible representation of $GL_n(F)$?

89190,"I'm sure I'm not the only one with this quandary so hopefully this question is suitable for Mathoverflow. I'm posting anonymously for obvious reasons.

In a couple of my papers I have answered questions which were fairly well known inside my sub-field and posed by well known people. However the solutions themselves are not hard - they do not involve any substantially new idea other than perhaps the insight that some well-known techniques in a slightly different field could be of use. In the end I submitted (and published) to journals taking into account more the difficulty of the solution rather than the prestige of the problem. Several people later told me I could/should have aimed higher.

Now I am in a similar situation with a couple of papers in preparation where the techniques I use are well-known but they have just not been applied to the type of problems I solve (which again are questions asked by very good people and open for at least a while. They are not major famous questions). Maybe I just have a good smell for low hanging fruit!

89195,"I have the conjecture stated below which would be very helpful for a cryptographic security proof I'm working on for several months now. At first glance it seemed a pretty natural question to me but after asking a lot of people and also searching the internet I'm still without a solution or any helpful hints. This is the conjecture:

Let any multivariate polynomial $f\in\mathbb R[X_1\ldotsX_n]$ be given such that the corresponding variety $V_f$ is not empty: $V_f=\{x\in\mathbb R^n\|\f(x)=0\}\neq\emptyset$. Then there exists some constant $c>0$ such that for all $x\in\mathbb R^n$ one can estimate the distance of $x$ from $V$ as follows: $c\cdot\min_{y\in V_f}\|x-y\|^{\deg f}\leq|f(x)|$.

In particular I only need this to hold true if $\deg(f)\leq4$ and $x$ is only taken from a compact set $K\subset\mathbb R^n$. If the conjecture turns out true it can be used for generalization of a classification result of mine in theoretic cryptography. Here are some further notes:


Since all norms on $\mathbb R^n$ are equivalent the assertion either holds true for every norm or for none.
If $K\cap V_f=\emptyset$ one can just set $c:=\min_{x\in Ky\in V_f}|f(x)|\cdot\|x-y\|^{-\deg f}$. So the ""interesting"" values $x$ are close to $V$.
If the conjecture is not true then there exists a counterexample with irreducible polynomial $f$. Given any reducible counterexample say $f=g\cdot h$ we can estimate $\min_{y\in V_f}\|x-y\|^{\deg f}$ by $\min_{y\in V_g}\|x-y\|^{\deg g}\cdot\min_{y\in V_h}\|x-y\|^{\deg h}$ and it follows straightforwardly that $g$ or $h$ must be a counterexample too.
If $n=1$ i.e. $f$ is univariate the conjecture is true since the only irreducible polynomials with non-empty variety are of the form $f(x)=ax+b$. Clearly these are no counterexamples and thus as mentioned above there don't exist any univariate counterexamples at all.
I was able to prove the weak variant of the conjecture with $x\in K$ for the case that $\deg(f)\leq2$ but the proof is quite long; it can be found here.

Moving upward one encounters 'algebraic phenomena'"" which lead to ""to the context-free grammars and context-free languages of Chomsky and to several related topics.""

A cofibration in $F_n(C)$ is a commutative ladder consisting of ""lattices"". See the attached PDF for a precise definition.

Waldhausen gives a beautiful graphical proof that there is an equivalence $F_n F_m C \cong F_m F_n C$ (Lemma 1.1.5).

Is it possible to ""glue"" these $X_i$'s together (analogous to the example above) to get a strong Markov process on all of $E$?

I think I can make sense of my example by looking at the infinitesimal generator for the process and observing that it is ""nice"" and therefore is the generator of a strong Markov process.  Perhaps I can use the same sort of idea in general if the $X_i$ are ""nice"" (that is if the $X_i$ have ""nice"" generators operating on $C_0(U_i)$ I can use them to construct a nice generator on $C_0(E)$ and then use general theory to say there is a process with this generator) but I'm wondering if there is anything in the literature on this sort of construction.

89269,"Hi all.  My question today will be regarding what I consider to be a ""stumbling block"" while trying to research odd perfect numbers.

Let $N = {q^k}{n^2}$ be an odd perfect number with Euler prime $q$.  Since $\gcd(q n) = 1$ we know that $q \neq n$.

In 2008 I proved that $q^k &lt; n^2$.  This implies that if $n &lt; q$ then Sorli's conjecture that $k = {\nu}_q(N) = 1$ would follow.

I currently know that $I(q) \leq 6/5 &lt; \sqrt{5/3} &lt; I(n)$ where $I(x) = \sigma(x)/x$ is the abundancy index of $x$.  In particular this means that $$\frac{\sigma(q)}{\sigma(n)} &lt; \frac{q}{n}$$.

Thus if $q &lt; n$ then $\sigma(q) &lt; \sigma(n)$.  (The contrapositive of this last implication is $\sigma(n) &lt; \sigma(q)$ implies that $n &lt; q$.)

Now since $\sigma(q) = q + 1$ I believe we have three cases to consider:

Case 1:  $q &lt; \sigma(q) &lt; n &lt; \sigma(n)$

Case 2:  $n &lt; q &lt; \sigma(q) \leq \sigma(n)$

Case 3:  $n &lt; \sigma(n) \leq q &lt; \sigma(q)$

I also know that $$\frac{\sigma(q)}{n} \neq \frac{\sigma(n)}{q}.$$

My problem is:  How do I dispose of Case 2?  The motivation is that I want to establish an equivalence between the inequalities $\frac{\sigma(q)}{n} &lt; \frac{\sigma(n)}{q}$ and $q &lt; n$.  This way all it takes to prove Sorli's conjecture will be to show that $\frac{\sigma(n)}{q} &lt; \frac{\sigma(q)}{n}$.

My idea is to show that $$\frac{\sigma(q)}{\sigma(n)} \leq 1 &lt; \frac{q}{n}$$ cannot occur by considering two separate cases under Case 2:

Case 2A:  $\frac{\sigma(q)}{n} &lt; \frac{\sigma(n)}{q}$

Under this case:

$$\frac{\sigma(n)}{q} > \sqrt[4]{\frac{5}{3}}$$
$$2 > \frac{\sigma(n)}{n} > \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}$$

The way I know how to prove this statement is as follows.

First it suffices to prove the case when $X$ is countable.  Thus we can choose a bijection between $X$ and $\mathbb{Q} \cap [01]$.  To save notation we can tacitly assume that $X = \mathbb{Q} \cap [01]$.  

Let the index set be $A = [01] \setminus X$ i.e. all the irrationals in $[01]$.  For each $\alpha \in A$ choose a sequence  $(x_{\alpha 1}x_{\alpha 2}\dots)$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_{\alpha n} \to \alpha$ as $n \to \infty$ and let $X_\alpha = \{ x_{\alpha_n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.

Since $\alpha$ is irrational the sequence $(x_{\alpha n})$ cannot be eventually constant so $X_\alpha$ is infinite.  And if $\alpha \neq \beta$ then the sequences $(x_{\alpha n})$ and $(x_{\beta n})$ can have only finitely many terms in common since they have different limits so $X_\alpha \cap X_\beta$ is finite.

Is it possible to do this in a more constructive way?  I know very little about set theory and logic so I apologize if this question is too elementary.  Also I wasn't sure about any relevant tags other than set-theory so please feel free to add appropriate tags.

Edit: to clarify I didn't have a clear notion of what I meant by ""constructive"" here.  What I didn't like about the proof I gave above was that it required a choice of sequence of rationals converging to each irrational.  The answers so far all address this concern adequately.

89342,"Hello

I want to take a unit $n$-ball $B_n$ and quotient it by some subgroup $G \subset \mathbb{Z}_2^n$. 

Here is a sketch of the construction: take the obvious inscribed $n$-hypercube of $B_n$; we can associate the hypercube's vertices with the $2^n$ bitstrings of length $n$ and take some sub-vector space (thought of as a subgroup) $G$ of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$. We can then think of $G$ as identifying the vertices of the hypercube and it is fairly obvious that we can then quotient $B_n$ by $G$ to get some quotient space $B_n/G$.

Now I'm interested in constructing a ""tangent bundle"" for this quotient which is not quite a manifold and then calculate / construct the Stiefel-Whitney classes for this bundle. I use quotes since I'm not sure about how to do this or if it is well-defined. 


are the quotients $B_n/G$ for these ""well-behaved looking"" $G$ well-understood as topological spaces? In particular do we know their cohomologies? I can see $H^1(B_n/G) = G$ but that's about it for now =) It looks like equivariant cohomology would come into play but my topology skills are elementary and I don't have a feeling of what is ""easy"" or ""hard"" in equivariant cohomology.
what is the correct notion of ""tangent bundle"" for this kind of orbifold if any? $B_n$ itself is a nice $n$-manifold with boundary so it seems like I want to look at something like $TB_n/G \rightarrow B_n/G$ but I am in alien waters and I feel I should be careful about singularities. 
A natural followup question: if so we can formally define Stiefel-Whitney classes (and spin structures). Are its Stiefel-Whitney classes well-understood?

What I have been wondering about is that there must be a good reason they are called generic points. Here are what I have got so far:


A non-closed generic point is not closed so it cannot be cut out from the scheme by any polynomial equations in any affine patch and thus it does not posses any extra algebraic property that's not shared by others.
A non-closed generic point is not a specialization of the scheme.

89398,"Let $X$ be a scheme and $F$ be an injective object of $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$. Is it true that $F$ is acyclic with respect to the usual sheaf cohomology?

For noetherian schemes $X$ this is well-known; then $F$ even turns out to be flasque. I don't really care for pathological schemes but I would like to know if it's true for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes.

If $X$ is affine then it is also well-known (no matter if $X$ is noetherian or not) because then actually every quasi-coherent module is acyclic. Remark that even on an affine scheme whose underlying topological space is noetherian there are injective quasi-coherent modules which are not flasque (SGA 6 Exp. II App. I); but of course this does not influence the answer.

The background is that I would like to define cohomology within $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ without using the category of (not necessarily quasi-coherent) $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules or even all sheaves on $X$. This works because $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ is a Grothendieck category (without any assumptions on $X$) thus has enough injective objects. This cohomology would turn out to be the usual sheaf cohomology (i.e. computed in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$) if and only if injective objects are acyclic with respect to the usual sheaf cohomology.

EDIT: a-fortiori answers the question affirmatively if $X$ is quasi-compact and semi-separated. Is there any chance to get the result also when $X$ is just assumed to be quasi-compact and quasi-separated? I've already convinced myself that the proof cannot be translated verbatim.

plot of the function via Wolfram|Alpha

I am looking for a simple/standard/illuminating proof of the fact that $\theta(q)$ is convex for $q\in[01]$. The proof I found goes like this: We have

$$\theta'(q) = 2\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n n^2 q^{n^2-1}$$

and one can show that for some $q_0\in(01)$ $n^2q^{n^2-1} - (n+1)^2q^{(n+1)^2-1}$ is increasing in $[0q_0]$ for any $n\ge 2$. This gives convexity of $\theta(q)$ in $[0q_0]$. For the remaining values of $q$ one uses the representation of $\theta$ as a sum over Gaussian kernels:

$$\theta(e^{-\pi^2t/2}) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi t}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{(2n-1)^2}{2t}\right)$$

With this representation one can show that the second derivative (wrt $q$) of each summand is positive for $q \ge q_1$ with $q_1 &lt; q_0$. This yields convexity of theta.

I don't like this proof because it requires calculating $q_1$ and $q_0$ explicitly and it is not very illuminating. I tried playing around with the representation of $\theta(q)$ as the infinite product

$$\theta(q) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty (1-q^{2n-1})^2(1-q^{2n})$$

but didn't manage to find anything except that the partial products

$$\prod_{n=1}^N (1-q^{2n-1})^2(1-q^{2n})$$

all seem to be convex in $[01]$ which would prove the statement.

The special unitary group SU(3) is a inherent component of the standard model of particle physics. It models the gauge field of the color charge property that is related the strong particle interaction.
Generally for SU(n) matrices are used as a representation of the generators of its Lie algebra.
Those matrices (L_i) are complex traceless and antihermitian and their Lie bracket is the commutator.
The structure constants f_abc are defined by [L_aL_b]=2i*f_abc*L_c
The matrices in this set that are diagonal form a basis for the Cartan subalgebra.

Gell-Mann proposed a set of eight 3D-matrices (L_i i=1 to 8) to be used for SU(3) in the standard model.
They are similar to the Pauli matrices in the SU(2)-case.
Additionally Gell-Mann requires that all eight matrices are trace orthogonal or that 
tr(L_a L_b)=2*delta(ab) for a and b =1 to 8.
This means that the 9-dimensional vectors corresponding to the matrices are orthogonal.
The basis for the Cartan-algebra in this case is the pair L_3 and L_8. 
All entries in L_3 and L_8 are zero except 
L_3(11)=-L_3(22)=sqrt(3)*L_8(11)=sqrt(3)*L_8(22)=-.5*sqrt(3)*L_8(33)=1.
The completely antisymmetric structure constants are:
.5* f_123=f_147=f_165=f_246=f_257=f_345=f_376=.5 f_458=f_678=sqrt(3)*.5

In G-Mâs particular choice of the matrices you see the appearance of the sqrt(3). I have the feeling that the expressions could be simpler (without sqrt(3)) if L_8 is replaced by (L_3+L_8) 
so that the entries of L_8 are all zero except L_8(22)= -L_8(33)=1.
Of course the structure constants would change:
F_123=f_678=f_458=f_345=1f_147=f_165=f_246=f_257=f_376=f_128=.5
However we would get tr(L_3 L_8) =.5 instead of 0.

Moreover let $U_{i} \to X$ and $Y\to X$ be morphisms in $C$ and $U\to X$ be the morphism induced by the universality of coproduct. Then $U\times_{X}Y \cong \coprod_{i}(U_{i}\times_{X}Y)$.

If $C$ is the category of schemes this statement will be true. This is because fiber products of schemes are constructed locally at first and glued together.

However I could not prove this by using universality (i.e. in categorical settings).

My questions are:


Is the above statement true? If so then how can one prove it?
If the statement is false what kind of counter example exists?
If the statement is false then please change the statement replacing ""coproducts"" by ""disjoint unions"". Is the NEW statement true?


Here disjoint union of $U_{i}$'s means coproduct $U=\coprod_{i}U_{i}$ satisfying that the fiber products $U_{i}\times_{U}U_{j}$ are the strict initial object if $i \neq j$. Here strict initial object means initial object $\phi$ such that for any object $X$ the set of morphisms $Hom(X \phi)$ is the empty set if $X$ is not isomorphic to $\phi$. (This is the generalization of empty set in the category of sets or schemes.)

Counterexamples for the first statement exist (e.g. the category of pointed sets or the opposite of the category of sets).

However those are not for the refined statement in my question 3.

For $p > 2$ the $p$-variation of the curve making $n^2$ turns around a circle of radius $1/n$ goes to $0$ when $n \to +\infty$.  On the other hand the area enclosed by each of these curves is exactly $\pi$.

I'm looking for such an example for $p = 2$.  That is I'm looking for a sequence of piecewise smooth closed curves whose $2$-variation goes to zero but such that the $\liminf$ of the sequence of areas enclosed by each curve is positive.

My motivation is that I'm studying the book ""Differential equations driven by rough paths"" (by T. Lyons et al).  They give the example above for $p > 2$ and state that one can construct such an example for $p = 2$.  However I haven't been able to do so so far.  

This example would show that there is no way to define ""enclosed area"" as a continuous functional on the space of continuous curves with finite $2$-variation.  Hence is important in motivating the theory of rough paths because it shows that attempting to extend the Young integral (which works for $1 \le p &lt; 2$) any further is hopeless.

89475,"As far as I know there are four possible ways to generalize algebraic geometry by 'simply' replacing the basic category of rings with something similar but more general:

$\bullet$ In the approach by Toen-VaquiÃ© we fix a nice symmetric monoidal category $C$ also called a relative context. An affine scheme is defined to be an algebra object in $C$ and an arbitrary scheme is a certain presheaf on affine schemes. We optain the category $\mathrm{Sch}(C)$ of schemes relative to $C$.

$\bullet$ In Durov's theory a generalized ring is an algebraic monad which is commutative in a certain sense. Then affine schemes are defined to be the spectra of generalized rings and arbitrary schemes are optained by gluing. This results in the category $\mathrm{genSch}$.

$\bullet$ In his book Categories of commutative algebras Yves Diers considers Zariski categories which seem to axiomatize familiar properties of categories of commutative algebras. If $\mathcal{A}$ is such a Zariski category then one can develope commutative algebra internal to $\mathcal{A}$ construct affine schemes and then by gluing also schemes as usual. We optain the category $\mathrm{Sch}(\mathcal{A})$.

$\bullet$ In derived algebraic geometry one replaces the category of rings with the category of simplicial rings (but I don't really know enough about that yet).

My question is: What are the connections between these 'generalized algebraic geometries'?

Fortunately there is a map of $\mathbb{F}_1$-land which draws connections between all these various approaches to schemes over $\mathbb{F}_1$. For example monoid schemes Ã  la Deitmar/Kato are in the intersection of Toen-VaquiÃ¨ and Durov. Note however that the theories mentioned above are far more general.

Specifically one might ask the following questions: Is the category of generalized rings a Zariski category and is Durov's theory (say with the unary localization theory) a special case of the one by Yves Diers? What is the relationship between Toen-VaquiÃ© schemes relative to the symmetric monoidal category of simplicial rings and derived schemes? If $C$ is a relative context is then the category of algebra objects in $C$ a Zariski category and do the corresponding schemes coincide? Probably not because Diers never mentions monoids as an example but perhaps it's the other way round? Of course many more questions are out there ...

Let $T$ be the topology on $C$ associated to $B$ (i.e. $Cov T$ consists of universal effective  epimorphic families {$f_{i}:U_{i}\to U$} in $C$ such that each $f_{i}$ is a morphism in $B$).

Moreover assume that the topology $T$ satisfies the following two conditions:

Condition II

Under the situation above 

Let $R$ be a categorical equivalence relation on an object $U \in C$ such that the two canonical projections $\pi_{i}: R\to U$ ($i=12$) are both covering maps of $U$ in the topology $T$.

And assume that this categorical equivalence has $T$-quotient $X$. This means that there exists a categorical quotient $p:U\to X$ of $\pi_{i}:R\to U$ such that the induced morphism of associated sheaves (on $T$) $p_{\ast}:h_{U} \to h_{X}$ is a categorical quotient of $\pi_{i \ast}:h_{R}\to h_{U}$ in the category of sheaves of sets on $T$.

89527,"Search problem $MIN^P$ is given a polynomial-time computable predicate that is a partial order to find its minimum (any will do).

Search problem $MIN^L$ is given a polynomial-time computable predicate that is a linear order to find its minimum.

Search problems can be interpreted as computational models (complexity classes) namely as polynomial time bounded computations plus an oracle solving instances of the search problem.

More formally for example for linear orders:  Enhance a polynomial time bounded Turing machine $S$ with an oracle.  The oracle input always consists of a number $n$ and a code of another Turing machine $T$.  Machine $T$ (accepts pairs of integers and) computes an order relation $&lt;^L$ on integers from $0$ to $n$ and is constructed to guarantee termination in polynomial time.
The oracle then outputs a minimum number $m$ (that is $0 \le m \le n$ and $(\forall x) 0 \le x \le n \implies  m &lt;^L x \vee m = x$).  In case the machine $T$ supplied to the oracle is invalid (not a Turing machine code or defining a relation which is not a linear order up to $n$) the oracle is free to output any value.  Note that the size of $n$ is by definition polynomial in the size of the input to the Turing machine $S$ but its value may be exponential and therefore the oracle may add computational power beyond polynomial time computable functions.

My question is: can this computation model (call it $MIN^L$) solve $MIN^P$?

To further clarify here is a trivial proof of the converse.   $S$ will get some $n$ and a code of a Turing machine.  It will simply feed both as $n$ and $T$ to its oracle and output the oracle answer which is the desired minimum.

This question is bugging me for some time.  A negative answer would entail some quite interesting consequences for fragments of bounded arithmetic.

I guess the answer is YES. The reason is the following - as far as I understand algebra of endo-functors of Vect is isomorphic to the algebra of symmetric functions.

[EDIT] this is wrong (Thanks to Martin). Automorphism $C$ of any object $V$ gives end-functor twisting morphisms by $C$ and/or $C^{-1}$ ( i.e. $Mor(VA)$ twisted by $C$  $Mor(AV)$ twisted by $C^{-1}$ hence $Mor(VV)$ twisted by $C ...C^{-1}$).

why this cosntruction is somewhat natural. So may be categorical point of view may clarify.

Operations of functors are defined as follows: take  FG: Vect-> Vect
we want to multiply them i.e. to define new functor $FG$ it is defined on objects as follows:

$FG: V-> F(V)\otimes G(V)$ 

and on morphisms it is defined respectively $\phi: V->W$

$FG(\phi): F(V)\otimes G(V) \to F(W)\otimes G(W)$ 

$FG(\phi)= F(\phi) \otimes G(\phi)$.

Suppose you have two smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ and maps $f:M \rightarrow N$ as well as
$g: M \rightarrow N$ then if there is a $m \in M$ and an open neighbourhood $U$ of $m$ in $M$ such that the equation

$$f(x) = g(x)$$

holds on $U$ then clearly $j^1_mf = j^1_mg$.

The inverse Problem is when you have
jet equivalence classes $j^1_mf j^1_mg \in J^1_m(MN)$ with 
$$j_mf = j_mg$$

then is there an open neighbourhood $U$ of $m$ in $M$ and representatives $f \in j_mf$ as well as $g \in j_mg$ such that the equation $f(x) = g(x)$ holds on $U$ ?

Surely there are but what is the argument in situations like this? (The functor properties of $J^1$ doesn't really fits here I guess because the problem is inverse) 

The point is that I can't come up with a formal correct argument and when the situation gets more involved it is hard to say if the inverse question has a solution or not due to the lack of an correct argument. 

For example:

Suppose you have smooth manifolds and jet equivalence classes 

$$j_{m_1}^1f \in J^1_{m_1}(M_1N_1)$$
$$j_{m_2}^1h \in J^1_{m_2}(M_2N_2)$$
$$j_{n_1}^1g_1 j_{n_1}^1g_2  \in J^1_{n_1}(N_1N_2)$$
$$j_{m_1}^1k_1j_{m_1}^1k_2 \in J^1_{m_1}(M_1M_2)$$

(with $k_1(m_1) = m_2 = k_2(m_1)$ $f(m_1)=n_1$ $g_1(n_1)=h(m_2)=g_2(n_2)$  and a system of two jet equation of first order jets

$$j^1_{n_1}g_1 \circ j^1_{m_1}f = j^1_{m_2} h \circ j^1_{m_1}k_1$$
$$j^1_{n_1}g_2 \circ j^1_{m_1}f = j^1_{m_2} h \circ j^1_{m_1}k_2$$

and you know that this equation holds! So the question is not whether or
not the jets satisfy the equation but the equation is taken for granted.

But the inverse problem is the question whether or not there are appropriate reprensentatives $g_1' \in j^1_{n_1}$ $\ldots$ (and all others) and an open neighbourhood $U$ of $m_1$ in $M_1$ such that

$$g_1 \circ f(x) = h \circ k_1(x)$$
$$g_2 \circ f(x) = h \circ k_2(x)$$

holds on $U$.

I apologize if my post is slightly vague as I am not an expert in this area. I will use capital roman letters to denote objects or complexes but the usage is clearly stated.

Motivation

To motivate my question let us start from a single object $M$ in an Abelian category $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ has enough projectives we can form a projective resolution $P\to M$ of $M$ and apply a right exact additive functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ to $P$ and calculuate homology. Here $\mathcal{D}$ is just some other abelian category. This will give us the derived functors of $F$ and is a standard and well-known construction.

Of course it doesn't stop there. In the same abelian category $\mathcal{C}$ with enough projectives any chain complex $M$ also has a (left) Cartan-Eilenberg resolution $P\to M$. Recall $P$ is an upper half plane double complex and the map $P\to M$ is just a chain map $P_{*0}\to A$. Finally $P$ is required to satisfy some axioms making it into a sort of 2-dimensional version of a projective resolution. I won't go into detail because this is also fairly standard.

The point is that we can also apply a right-exact functor $F$ to this double complex $P$ and take the the homology of the total direct-sum complex of $P$ (if it exists!); that is $H_i(Tot^\oplus(FP))$ to get the hyperderived functors of $F$.

The Question

It seems as though there is a natural generalization. One can easily define an $n$-complex in an analogous fashion to $2$-complexes. Higher dimensional complexes don't really show up much as far as I can tell although I believe in Cartan-Eilenberg a $4$-complex is used somewhere (sorry I don't have the book with me!).

So I suppose my question is:


  Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is an abelian category with enough projectives. Is it true that for any $n$ an $n$-complex $M$ has some appropriate higher Cartan-Eilenberg resolution (which would be an $n+1$-complex)?


Appropriate means that if $P\to M$ is this hypothetical higher Cartan-Eilenberg resolution then applying a right exact additive functor $F$ to $P$ and taking the homology of the total direct-sum (if it exists) complex gives the ""correct"" notion of $n$-hyperderived functors.

Comments

I have searched the literature for this concept but I could not find anything relevant. I am thinking that there are two possibilities (a) yes higher Cartan-Eilenberg resolutions exists and are interesting or (b) yes higher Cartan-Eilenberg resolutions exist but don't capture any new information and so are not that interesting. I'd be a bit surprised if they don't exist but I do not have enough experience in homological algebra to understand the bigger picture here.

Also we could have phrased this question in terms of injectives and (right) Cartan-Eilenberg resolutions.

89604,"It is known that a manifold $B$ bounds a compact contractible topological manifold if and only if $B$ is a homology sphere. The ""only if"" direction follows by excising a small ball in the interior of the contractible manifold and noting that its boundary sphere has the same homology as $B$ by Poincare duality. The ""if"" direction is due to Freedman in dimension $3$ and to Kervaire in dimensions $>3$.

 Question. Is there a characterization of boundaries of
noncompact contractible manifolds? 

Note that if $B$ is a boundary component of a contractible $n$-manifold $W$ then
the following holds.


If $B$ is compact then $W$ is compact and $\partial W=B$. 
(If $V$ denotes the union of $B$ and the interior of $W$ then
the long exact sequence of the pair gives $H_{n-1}(B)\cong H_{n}(VB)$ 
and Poincare duality gives implies that $H_{n-1}(B)$ is nontrivial
and hence so is $H_{n}(VB)\cong H^0_c(V)$ which is only possible 
if $V$ is compact.) 
$B$ is stably parallelizable (because $W$ is parallelizable).
If $U$ is a proper open subset of $B$ then $U$ bounds a noncompact contractible manifold namely $U\cup\mathrm{Int}(W)$. 
The product of $B$ with any open contractible manifold bounds a noncompact contractible manifold.
If $B'$ bounds a contractible manifold $W'$ then the connected sum
$B# B'$ bounds a contractible manifold namely the boundary connected sum of $W$ $W'$.

Then there is an equivalence $$\widehat{\mathcal{C}} / P \cong \widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}} P$$ Now there are (at least) two ways to see this (from what I've managed to ascertain.) You might derive the equivalence as it were 2-categorically using the universal property of $\widehat{\mathcal{C}}$ which is the equivalence $\textbf{Cat}/\widehat{\mathcal{C}} = \textbf{Func }(\widehat{\mathcal{C}}) \cong \textbf{DFib}(\mathcal{C})$ where $A$ is any small category and $\textbf{DFib}$ are the discrete fibrations over $\mathcal{C}$. You do this by showing that any functor $A \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P$ corresponds to a functor $A \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}$ and a natural transformation $A \rightarrow 1 \overset{P}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{C}$ (where $1$ is terminal in $\textbf{Cat}$) and hence that the corresponding morphism of fibrations corresponds to a discrete fibration of ${\int_{\mathcal{C}}}P$ and hence that 

$$\textbf{Func }(\widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P) \cong \textbf{DFib}(\int_{\mathcal{C}}P) \cong \textbf{Func }(\widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P}) $$ 

which by universality gives the desired equivalence. Now I have to admit I'm a bit sketchy on the details of this as it uses many non-obvious properties of fibrations. A more detailed version of this approach was given as a partial answer to this question.

I am more interested in the more elementary approach i.e. establishing an explicit equivalence between the two categories so that I can understand morally why this equivalence ought to hold. The only natural functor I've been able to find between the two is given firstly by factorizing $$\int_{\mathcal{C}}P \overset{\pi_P}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{C} \overset{y}{\rightarrow} \widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ through the Yoneda embedding to $\widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P}$ and the canonical colimit functor $L : \widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P} \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}$ given since $y \circ \pi_P$ is a functor to a cocomplete category and then getting to $\widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P$ by pullback $p$ along $P \rightarrow 1$. So the end result is a functor $$ p \circ L: \widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P} \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P$$ Does this functor provide the desired equivalence? There seems to be significant loss of information at $p$ but on the other hand $L$ does have the property that it makes the two respective Yonneda embeddings commute (i.e. $L \circ y = y \circ \pi_P$) so morally it seems that the information lost at $p$ should be the same amount of information lost by the projection $\pi_P : \int_{\mathcal{C}}P \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ (which ought to make $p \circ L$ full and faithful; and I think essential surjectivity is straightforward.)

But I also get the sense I am chatting nonsense. If this functor does nothing of the sort then the question I suppose is what is the most elementary functor that provides this equivalence?

Let $e_n$ be the unit vectors of $\ell_2(\mathbb N_0)$ $K_1=\overline{\Gamma(e_0+\frac{1}{n} e_n: n\in\mathbb N)}$ (where $\Gamma$ denotes the absolutly convex hull) and $K_2 = \overline{ \Gamma(-e_0+\frac{1}{n} e_n: n\in\mathbb N)}$.

$f_j: K_1+K_2 \to  C K_j$ with $f_1(z)+f_2(z)=z$ for $C=3$ (namely $f_1(z)=z$ $f_2(z)=0$).

89668,"It is well known that every partial order on a set can be extended
to a linear order on that set. That is for every partial order
$\lhd$ on a set $X$ there is a linear order $\prec$ on $X$ such
that ${\lhd}\subseteq\prec$ meaning $a\lhd b\implies a\prec b$. In the
most general case with uncountable $X$ one appeals to Zorn's
lemma. For relations on $\mathbb{N}$ however the linearization
process is effective. My question concerns the relative complexity
of such linearizations $\prec$ in comparison with the original
order $\lhd$. (See also Jirka Hanika's
related question on reducing minimal element search for partial orders to that of linear orders in the
case of finite orders.)

Question. Does every polynomial time decidable partial order
relation $\lhd$ on $\mathbb{N}$ extend to a polynomial time
decidable linear order relation on $\mathbb{N}$?

I expect not. I think there will be a polynomial time decidable
partial order relation on $\mathbb{N}$ that does not extend to any
polynomial time linear order. The reason I believe so is that the
natural method of constructing a linear order extending a given
partial order seems to proceed fundamentally in series rather than
parallel in the sense that one gradually linearizes increasing
portions of the partial order but one must keep track of what one
did earlier in order not to conflict with later decisions. But
with a polynomial time construction one cannot afford to inspect
the earlier parts of the linearization.

Meanwhile every computable partial order $\lhd$ on $\mathbb{N}$
does extend to a computable linear order $\prec$ on $\mathbb{N}$ and this is what I meant when I said that linearizaton is effective by
the following procedure: at stage $n$ we know how the numbers up
to $n$ relate with respect to $\lhd$ and we have built the desired
relation $\prec$ on the numbers below $n$. The new number $n$
divides this linear order into those that are $\lhd$-below $n$
incomparable to $n$ and $\lhd$-above $n$. We may now proceed to
linearize $n$ into the order by placing $n$ as high as possible
say above all the nodes so far to which it is incomparable if
any. This recursive procedure produces a linear order extending
$\lhd$.

The point for the question is that this algorithm seems to require
an exponential increase in the time complexity since on a given
input one must construct the relation on all nodes up to that node
before knowing what to do and this takes exponential time. Indeed
it isn't even clear whether one should be able to find a
linearization in the class NP.

Question. Does every polynomial time partial order extend to
an NP linear order?

I expect not since even a polynomial size certificate seems
insufficient in general to track the linearization construction
which has exponential size.

Finally let me point out that the analogue at the level of c.e.
orders attains the negative result.

Theorem. There is a c.e. partial order $\lhd$ on
$\mathbb{N}$ that does not extend to any c.e. linear order on
$\mathbb{N}$.

Proof. Part of the point is that every c.e. linear order is
actually decidable. Let $AB\subset\mathbb{N}$ be computable
inseparable c.e. sets meaning that they are disjoint c.e. sets and
there is no decidable set containing $A$ and disjoint from $B$.
Define the partial order $\lhd$ by placing every element of $A$
below $0$ and $0$ below every element of $B$ but otherwise
elements are incomparable. This is a c.e. relation since given two
numbers $a$ and $b$ we can say how they are related once they are
enumerated into $A$ or $B$ and otherwise they are unrelated. But
if the relation extends to a linear order $\prec$ on $\mathbb{N}$
then the set of $\prec$-predecessors of $0$ will be a computable
separation of $A$ and $B$ a contradiction. QED

Can one similarly employ a polytime version of inseparability to
answer the main question?

As a new user I'm not allowed to include image tags but I've included the URL at the bottom of the page as I always think I'm better able to explain myself with visual aids.  The picture demonstrates what I mean with Apollonius circles connecting the 3 nearest ellipses to one another.

So far I have tried using the minimum distances between the ellipses and modifying Delaunay Triangulation via incremental and sweepline methods used various techniques involving in circles of triangles formed between every 3 ellipse configuration etc and attempted to estimate the neighbours with bounding boxes and have completely run out of ideas of how to actually get this working efficiently

Although I have worked out a solution it involves exhaustively searching and comparing every trio of ellipses with every other ellipse and has a time complexity of n(n-1)(n-2)/3!. And on top of that each calculation is done iteratively rather than algebraically.  

Would anyone even have an idea of how to go about this that could be done algebraically and at lower then a n^2 time complexity?

Even a suggestion of a technique would suit me to have a try at because right now I've been working at it for nearly 3 weeks and really am no closer to a decent answer.

Thank you in advance for any help

Ross.

When $G$ is finite it is of course the same as asking $G$ to be of odd order (i.e. that there's no $2$-torsion). But $T_2$ may fail even when $G$ has no $2$-torsion as shows $G = \mathbb{R}$.

89707,"One can cut a manifold up along the critical levels of a Morse function and deduce something about the topology. In particular the critical points (and the connecting gradient flowlines) define a chain complex which can be used to compute homology.

A minimal Morse function on a compact manifold is a Morse function which has exactly enough critical points to generate the homology (e.g. perfect if the homology is torsion free). The existence of a minimal Morse function on a simply-connected h-cobordism between simply-connected manifolds of high enough dimension is equivalent to the h-cobordism theorem.

Two Morse functions are called 'homotopy equivalent' if there is a diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity sending critical levels to critical levels. I don't know if this is the best terminology but it seems to be the one people use.

Matsumoto proved that on a simply-connected manifold any two minimal Morse functions which are homotopy equivalent are isotopic through Morse functions. This seems to be a beefed up version of the argument which proves the h-cobordism theorem.

Of course in the non-simply-connected case one expects something different. On page 45 of the English translation of Sharko's book 'Functions on manifolds: algebraic and topological aspects' (Translations of Mathematical Monographs AMS 1993) just after Corollary 2.3 he claims that there are examples of homotopy equivalent but nonisotopic Morse functions on non-simply-connected manifolds.

My question is: can anyone give me an example of a pair of homotopy equivalent but nonisotopic Morse functions on a non-simply-connected manifold? What about minimal ones?

The reference Sharko gives there seems to have nothing to do with this (it points to a paper of Heller 'Homological resolutions of complexes with operators' Ann. Math. 1954) so I assume the bibliographic numbering is flawed. If I check the adjacent and promising-looking reference (Hatcher and Wagoner's 'Pseudoisotopies of compact manifolds' Asterisque Volume 6 1973) I find that I would need to know more Cerf theory to work out what this example might look like.

$$0 = 1 \vdash \bot$$
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (\exists b . \; (1 - a) \times b = 1)$$
See for example [Sheaves in Geometry and Logic Ch. VIII Â§6]. Unfortunately because homomorphisms are only required to commute with the various things in the signature the homomorphisms here are just ring homomorphisms and need not be local. It appears to me that the neatest way to fix this is to introduce a unary relation symbol $(\quad) \in \mathfrak{m}$ with the intention that $\mathfrak{m}$ is interpreted as the unique maximal ideal of the local ring. Then by the usual rules for homomorphisms of models a homomorphism $R \to R'$ must map elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ to elements of $\mathfrak{m}'$. But is there a way to axiomatise the theory so that


we get a coherent or at least geometric theory and
the category of models in $\textbf{Set}$ is indeed the category of local rings and local ring homomorphisms and
the structure sheaf homomorphism $\mathscr{O}_{Y} \to f_{*} \mathscr{O}_{X}$ of morphism of locally ringed spaces $X \to Y$ is a homomorphism in the category of models for this theory?


Ideally we'd like to define $\mathfrak{m}$ to be the subsheaf of nowhere invertible sections defined by
$$\{ s \in \mathscr{O} : \nexists t . \; s \times t = 1 \}$$
but unfortunately $\nexists t . \; s \times t = 1$ is not a geometric formula. (The formula $\forall t . \; s \times t \ne 1$ is equivalent to the previous one but has the same defect.) We can salvage one half of the biimplication as the geometric sequent
$$(a \in \mathfrak{m}) \land (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \vdash \bot$$
which merely expresses the requirement that ""$a$ is not in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is invertible"" but we also need to express the requirement that ""$a$ is in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is not invertible"". One possibility is the following:
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (a \in \mathfrak{m})$$
These two axioms appear to give the correct characterisation of $\mathfrak{m}$ in intuitionistic first order logic: it is easy to derive from these axioms that
$$a \in \mathfrak{m} \dashv \vdash \nexists b . \; a \times b = 1$$
so the interpretation of $\mathfrak{m}$ is completely determined by the axioms at least in a topos. 

But does every local ring object (in the sense of the first paragraph) admit an $\mathfrak{m}$ satisfying these axioms? The answer appears to be no for the reason that these axioms assert that a every section of a sheaf of a local ring admits an open cover of the space by open sets on which the restriction is either invertible or nowhere invertible â and this is certainly not true in the contexts of interest.

Write $\Omega$ for the canonical holomorphic $n$-form $\mathrm d z_1\cdots\mathrm d z_n$ on $\mathbb C^n$.  I am interested in integrals against the measure $\exp(s)\Omega$.
Specifically one can ask about integrals of the form $\int_\gamma f\exp(s)\Omega$ for some contour $\gamma$ where $f$ is a polynomial.

By a ""contour"" I mean a boundary-free (but not compact) real-$n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb C^n$.  For the integral to converge you'd like exponential decay at the ends of $\gamma$; i.e. at the ends of $\gamma$ we should have $\Re(s)\to -\infty$.  By Stokes' Theorem small perturbations of $\gamma$ don't matter and neither do compact cycles.  So all that matters in $\gamma$ is the class it represents in the relative homology group $\mathrm H_n(\mathbb C^n\lbrace \Re(s)\lt 0\rbrace)$.  If $n\gt 1$ by the long exact sequence for relative homology this group is equal to $\mathrm H_{n-1}(\lbrace \Re(s)\lt 0\rbrace)$.  (When $n=1$ it is the quotient of this by $\mathrm H_0(\mathbb C^n)$ which is one-dimensional.)

Stoke's theorem also implies that integrals of total derivatives (of functions that vanish at infinity) vanish.  Namely (provided $\gamma$ is as above) if $f$ is of the form $\frac{\partial g}{\partial z_i} + \frac{\partial s}{\partial z_i}g$ for some $i=1\dotsn$ and some polynomial $g$ then $\int_\gamma f\exp(s)\Omega = 0$.


  Thus the integral determines a pairing of the form
  $$ \textstyle \mathrm H_n\bigl(\mathbb C^n\lbrace \Re(s)\lt 0\rbrace\bigr) \otimes \bigl(\mathbb C[z_1\dotsz_n] / \sum_i (\text{image of } \frac{\partial}{\partial z_i} + \frac{\partial s}{\partial z_i})\bigr) \to \mathbb C $$
  My question is whether this pairing is perfect.  If it matters I am primarily interested in the case when $s$ is generic.


The answer is (somewhat trivially) ""yes"" when $n=1$ or when $d=2$.  When $n=2$ I convinced myself that the answer is yes for ""diagonal"" $s(z_1z_2) = z_1^d + z_2^d$; at least we calculated the dimension for $d=3$ and a similar argument should work for higher $d$.  At least some of the people I have asked have given the prediction that the answer is ""no"" in general.

For generic $s$ I have complete control over the ""algebraic side"": I can give an explicit basis for the quotient and for this basis and the monomial basis explicit formulas for the map.  An easy part of this is to see that this ""algebraic"" piece is $(d-1)^n$-dimensional.  

On the other hand I'm not very good at algebraic topology and algebraic geometry and the homology group is definitely inaccessible to pure algebra and is rather a piece of real algebraic geometry.  After talking with a number of folks at Berkeley we've been unable to calculate even the dimension of the relative homology group but maybe there were tricks we didn't think of.  Or maybe there's an a priori reason why the pairing is perfect and then I would have a calculation of this ""real topology"" side.

So if (1) is done the target is almost fulfilled except for the structure of $M_{tor}$.

I'm currently interested in the duality theorem for projective varieties and more specifically in properties of the conormal variety over the dual variety.

Let $V$ be a $k$-vector space over a field of characteristic 0. Denote by $V^\ast$ its dual space. Note that a point in the dual projective space $\mathbf{P}(V^\ast)$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbf{P}(V)$.

Given a projective variety $X\subset\mathbf{P}(V)$ the conormal variety is the Zariski closure in $\mathbf{P}(V)\times\mathbf{P}(V^\ast)$ of the set of tuples $(x[H])$ where $x$ is a regular point of $X$ and $H$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbf{P}(V)$ containing the embedded tangent space to $X$ at $x$. The projection to the factor $\mathbf{P}(V^\ast)$ is (by definition) the dual variety $X^\ast$ to $X$. The duality theorem states that the dual of $X^\ast$ is again $X$. (see e.g. ""Algebraic Geometry - A First Course"" by J. Harris Lecture 15)

An important point of the argument in the proof of the duality theorem in the book ""Algebraic Geometry - A First Course"" by J. Harris (Lecture 16 Example 16.20) is that the differentials of the projections $\pi_1\colon {\rm CN}(X)\to X$ and $\pi_2\colon {\rm CN}(X)\to X^\ast$ are surjective (for points in the fibre of smooth points $x\in X$ and $[H]\in X^\ast$).

  Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a finite morphism and suppose that $f$ is submersive at all points $x\in X$ such that $f(x)$ is a regular point of $Y$. Take a subvariety $W\subset Y$ and $x\in X$ such that $y:=f(x)$ is a regular point of $W$ (and a singular point of $Y$). Is it true that ${\rm d}f_x(T_x(X))\supset T_y(W)$ as subsets of the tangent cone $TC_y(Y)$. If so what is a reference for that?





  Let $X\subset \mathbf{P}^N$ $Y\subset\mathbf{P}^n$ be projective varieties and let $\pi\colon \mathbf{P}^N\to\mathbf{P}^n$ be a linear projection. Assume that $\pi(X)=Y$ and that for all regular points $x\in X$ such that $\pi(x)$ is a regular point of $Y$ we have $\pi(T_x(X))=T_{\pi(x)}(Y)$. Let $W\subset Y$ be a subvariety and $y\in W$ be regular point of $W$. Let $x$ be a regular point of $X$ with $\pi(x)=y$. Is it then true that $\pi(T_x(X))$ contains the tangent space $T_y(W)$ (as subsets of the tangent cone $TC_y(Y)$.

89787,"Explanations to a general mathematical audience about the Langlands programme often advertise it as ""non-abelian class field theory"". They usually begin as follows: a modern style formulation of classical class field theory is to say that for a global field $K$ the Artin map defines an isomorphism from the group of connected components of the idele class group to the Galois group $\operatorname{Gal}(K^{ab}|K)$. Pushing this even further we see that we have a canonical identification of characters of the idele class group with characters of the absolute Galois group $\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K}|K)$.

Then people usually go on to say that this should extend to a correspondence between a certain class of $n$-dimensional Galois representations and a certain class of representations of $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_K)$ (where $\mathbb{A}_K$ denotes the adeles of $K$) and very soon they have disappeared into (to me) far off realms.

While it should be clear from my description that I have no clue whatsoever concerning the Langlands programme I know a little bit about global class field theory in its traditional formulation. That is I understand it as a means to describe and classify abelian extensions of $K$ with prescribed ramifications with the Artin map giving an isomorphism from a ray ideal class group of $K$ (say) to the Galois group of the corresponding ray class field over $K$.

Then one has the standard degree filtration $U_{\leq n}$ on $U$ given by setting $$  U_{\leq n} := ( k[G]/I^{n+1} )^* .  $$

Set $\mathfrak g := $ Lie$(G)$. In characteristic 0 $U$ is just the enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak g$ and the PBW theorem tells us that the ring gr $ U $ is isomorphic to $S(\mathfrak g)$. Moreover there is a $G$-equivariant symmetrization isomorphism $S(\mathfrak g) \to U$ of vector spaces over $k$ where we take the conjugation action of $G$ on $U$ (note that this is NOT an algebra isomorphism however). Remark that the symmetrization isomorphism is given explicitly by $$  x_1 \cdots x_n \mapsto \frac 1 {n!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} x_{\sigma(1)} \cdots x_{\sigma(n)} . $$

Now assume that char $k = p > 0$. In this case gr $U$ is a commutative algebra -- let's call it $S'(\mathfrak g)$ -- that is not a polynomial ring.

Note that $S'(\mathfrak g)$ carries a natural $G$-module structure coming from the conjugation $G$-action on $U$.

89822,"I am not really familiar with homotopical category theory so please forgive me if I make rude mistakes. I know quite a bit of common category theory as well as familiar with algebraic topology.

How can one construct exact sequences abstractly in the framework of homotopical categories? Consider any model you like (topologically or simplicially enriched or $(\infty1)$-categories). nLab teaches us that to construct exact sequences in topology one needs to consider fiber sequences and homotopy limits/colimits. A fiber sequence $F\to E \to B$ is a homotopy pullback

\begin{array}{ccc} F &amp; \rightarrow &amp; E\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; B\\
\end{array}

The loop space $\Omega X$ of $X$ is defined as a homotopy pullback 

\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega X &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \ast \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; X\\
\end{array}

Dually one can define cofiber sequences and suspensions $\Sigma X$. We get a standard adjunction $\Sigma \vdash \Omega$. Given a fiber sequence one can have a long fiber sequence $\dots\to\Omega E \to \Omega B \to F \to E \to B$. To begin with consider a homotopy pullback rectangle

\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega B &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \ast \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\
F &amp; \rightarrow &amp; E\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; B\\
\end{array}

Standard diagram chasing and (homotopic) universality arguments show that we get a fiber sequence $\Omega  \to F \to E$ etc. Now if we apply the functor $\pi_0 \simeq \pi(\ast-)$ we get a sequence $$\dots \to \pi_0(\Omega E) \to \pi_0(\Omega B) \to \pi_0(F) \to \dots$$

Using the fact that $\pi_0$ preserves fiber sequences (because it is representable) and $\pi_0(\Omega^i X) \simeq \pi_i (X)$ we get a classical long exact sequence of homotopy groups for a fibration.

Now things get trickier if we consider homotopy pushouts instead of pullbacks. If we have a cover $(UV)$ of space $X$ then we have a homotopy pushout diagram

\begin{array}{ccc} U\cap V &amp; \rightarrow &amp; U \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\
V &amp; \rightarrow &amp; X\\
\end{array}

Standard arguments allow to replace this diagram with cofiber sequence $U \vee V \to X \to \Sigma (U\cap V)$. In theory it should give Seifert-van Kampen theorem and Mayer-Vietoris sequences in homology and cohomology in a similar way. In practice I don't understand how can this happen. To get Seifert-van Kampen theorem one should apply $\pi_1\simeq \pi_0 \circ \Omega$ but $\Omega$ fails to preserve cofiber sequences. Dold-Thom theorem tells us that $H_i = \pi_i \circ S$ where $S$ is the topological abelianization functor. We're fine with $S$ because it's a left adjoint to forgetful functor but we have the same problem with $\pi_i$. It doesn't preserve cofiber sequences. Even if it did we would have terms like $\pi_i (S \Sigma X)=H_i (\Sigma X) = H_{i-1}(X)$ for $i>0$ and that is nothing like an ascending sequence of homology groups. Even cohomology isn't fine: we can take the space of maps to $K(\mathbb{Z}1)$ and it turns cofiber sequences into fiber sequences but we still have a problem with grading like in case of homology.

So my question is: how can we deal with these difficulties and get the mentioned theorems? I didn't have any success till now in finding references on homotopy limits/colimits technique although many sources mention them and deal with technical properties like their existence in model categories. Any references would be greatly appreciated!

89824,"Following notions from [1] call a set of elements $g_1 \dots g_k \in G = SU(2)$ Diophantine if it satisfies the following property: there exists a constant $D$ such that for every word $W_m$ of length $m$ in $g_1 \dots g_k$ if $W_m \neq \pm e$ (identity element) then $\Vert W_m \pm e\Vert \geq D^{-m}$. It can be proved that elements with algebraic entries are Diophantine.

Bourgain and Gambrud prove that a certain property (spectral gap) holds for $g_1 \dots g_k$ that: a) generate a free subgroup of $SU(2)$ b) are Diophantine. The first property is generic in measure. The second is not known to be generic in measure but sets of Diophantine elements are dense in $G^k$ (since all rational-entry elements are). Does it follow that set of elements that a) generate free subgroup b) are Diophantine is dense in $G^{k}$?

Maybe it's almost obvious since the set of elements generating a free subgroup is a complement of a countable union of proper subvarieties but somehow one must rule out the possibility that being Diophantine and freeness are ""anticorrelated"" (a priori we only know that elements with algebraic elements are Diophantine and this is a countable set).

Clearly it is a compact convex subset included in $B$. It is a strict subset of $B$ because it does not meet  ${\bf O}_n^-(\mathbb R)$.

Remark also that this convex hull is invariant under multiplication at right or left by an element of ${\bf SO}_n(\mathbb R)$. Therefore it would be enough to decide which diagonal matrices ${\rm diag}(a_1\ldotsa_n)$ with $|a_1|\le a_2\le\cdots\le a_n$ it contains.

POSTSCRIPT:

My thanks to Noam Elkies for the highly detailed answer below. The background to this question is an identity I found involving $x^{10}+11x^5-1$. Define

$a = \frac{r^5(r^{10}+11r^5-1)^5}{(r^{30}+522r^{25}-10005r^{20}-10005r^{10}-522r^5+1)^2}$

and

$w = \frac{r^2(r^{10}+11r^5-1)^2(r^6+2r^5-5r^4-5r^2-2r+1)}{r^{30}+522r^{25}-10005r^{20}-10005r^{10}-522r^5+1}$

then

$w^5-10aw^3+45a^2w-a^2 = 0$

for arbitrary r. This in fact is the Brioschi quintic form which the general quintic can be reduced into.  Two of the polynomials are easily recognizable as icosahedral invariants while $r^6+2r^5-5r^4-5r^2-2r+1$ is a polynomial invariant for the octahedron.

Other than in formulas using Ramanujan's continued fractions I wondered where else those polynomials appear. Since the Bolza surface involved an invariant of the octahedron it was reasonable to consider if using the corresponding one for the icosahedron would also be special.  As Elkies wonderfully showed it turns out that it is.

89845,"firstI think we can avoid set theory to bulid the first order logic   by the operation of the finite string.but I have  The following questions:

How does ""meta-logic"" work. I don't really know this stuff yet but from what I can see right now meta-logic proves things about formal languages and logics in general. But does it use some logic to do so? Like if I want to prove that two formal languages are equivalent in some respect aren't I presupposing a ""background"" formal language? And won't my choice of a ""background"" (meta) language affect what I can and can't demonstrate? For example  what logic was Godel using when he proved his famous theorems? Was it a bivalent one? A three valued logic? etc

In shortI'm still not sure how reasoning about all possible formal languages work. For example suppose I say something of the form ""for all formal theories F if F has property X then F must have property Y"". If I wanted to prove something like that how does such very general reasoning work? What I mean is that in such a proof what kind of logic would be employed (for example would it be a two valued logic?) and does the choice of logic affect the outcome? Do logicians agree on some kind of meta-meta logic which they use to reason about absolutely everything? Or do they just choose their favorite one?

if metalogic is just predicate logicIt seems circular to me! we build the theory of predicate logic by using predicate logic?For example in proving some theorem in the object language we seem to assume that it is already correct (in the metalanguage). Or defining some connective in the object language we use that connective in the metalanguage to do so. It's like they're saying ""Alright guys! We are going to prove a bunch of stuff about logic! Oh by the way you have to take all this stuff we are about to prove for granted but don't worry that's just the ""metalanguage""."" Something about this seems wrong to me. Maybe I have misunderstood?

Certainly it was too late to correct the paper itself; yet its current arxiv version contains a short notice that it should be corrected.

Some call it mild (see the Thesis of Pablo Carrasco Compact Dynamical Foliations 2010) some call it strong and unnatural (see the work of Amy Wilkinson and Keith Burns Dynamical coherence accessibility and center bunching).

Notes:


For normal $A$ and $B$ the inequality holds; the proof is in arXiv:0711.2613. However the relation $\lambda_{ij}(C) = \lambda_i(A)+\lambda_j(B)$ significantly simplifies the problem.
The left hand side is a singular norm between Schatten and Ky Fan norm $\Vert X \Vert_{(pk)}=\sqrt[p]{\sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i^p}$. So the relation can viewed as a norm inequality $\Vert C \Vert_{(2n/2)}\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Vert C \Vert_{(2n^2)}$ for a special class of $C$.
The tracelessness of both $A$ and $B$ is necessary (otherwise numerical tests show that the inequality does not hold). Consequently standard tools (which does not take trace into account) like $k$th Ky Fan norm (here $k=2$) do not suffice. For example:
$$||C^\dagger C||^{k=2} \leq ||A^\dagger A\otimes I_4||^{k=2} + ||I_4\otimes B^\dagger B||^{k=2} + 
|| A^\dagger \otimes B + A \otimes B^\dagger||^{k=2} $$

I am sorry if this is a well known result but I was not able to find it in the literature.
In case I would really appreciate a reference for this.

the author states in the introduction that if $B$ is a metric space and the space of continuous functions $C(AB)$ in the compact-open topology is metrizable then $A$ is hemicompact. 

Later on Theorem 8 says: If $C(AB)$ satisfies the first axiom of countability and if for all points $xy \in A$ there is a continuous $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(x) \neq f(y)$ then $A$ is hemicompact. 

Now if $C(AB)$ is metrizable it's first countable. But I don't know how to find the $f$.

Added: In light of David's comment it's clear that Theorem 8 alone doesn't imply hemicompactness. Thus the question: 


  Is it true that if $B$ is a metric space and $C(AB)$ is metrizable then $A$ is hemicompact ? 


From the quoted Theorem 8 it's clear that if $A$ has in addition the separation property by continuous functions then it's hemicompact. But since the converse ($A$ hemicompact $B$ metric $\Rightarrow$ $C(A;B)$ metrizable) is true without this separation property I wonder if it's really necessary.

89912,"Recently I've been going over some of Serre's reformulation of Brauer theory with a student following the influential treatment in Part III of Serre's lectures (revised 1971 French edition) later published as Springer GTM 42 (1977) Linear Representations of Finite Groups.    This raises a question about the decomposition homomorphism relating Grothendieck groups in characteristic 0 and in characteristic $p&gt;0$.

BACKGROUND: Originally Brauer relied on fairly concrete arguments involving ""modular"" (now called Brauer) characters in order to compare the ordinary irreducible representations of a finite group $G$ over a ""large enough"" field  $K$ of characteristic 0 with those over a suitable finite field $k$.   Here ""large enough"" requires $K$ to contain all $m$th roots of unity where $m$ is the exponent of $G$: this forces $K$ to be a splitting field for $G$ and all its subgroups so irreducible representations are absolutely irreducible.     Now take  $K$ to be complete relative to a discrete valuation with valuation ring $A$ and residue field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$ dividing $|G|$.    Then $k$ is also ""large enough"" for $G$.

Serre follows the ideas of Swan and Giorgiutti working with Grothendieck groups (including those defined by projective modules over $A$ and $k$) to formulate Brauer's main results in terms of the cde-triangle.   Without assuming completeness the process of reduction modulo the unique maximal ideal of $A$ yields a well-defined homomorphism $d:R_K(G) \rightarrow R_k(G)$   of Grothendieck groups (via non-canonical choices of $A[G]$-lattices in modules).

He views as the main theorem here the surjectivity of $d$ when the fields are large enough or in other words the existence of a Brauer lifting of an irreducible representation over $k$ to a virtual representation over $K$.    (This kind of lifting was exploited for example by Quillen in his proof of the Adams Conjecture.)

Following the first publication (in typescript format) of Serre's lectures the improved 1971 edition includes a footnote in section 16.1 stating that Chevalley and Dress had independently proved the subjectivity of $d$ without the ""large enough"" hypothesis.   Apparently Chevalley never published his proof but Andreas Dress did publish a short note in J. Algebra 17 (1971) which I haven't yet looked at but have encouraged our German student to track down.    This note doesn't seem to have a citation history and isn't mentioned by Curtis-Reiner in their later treatment following Serre in Methods of Representation Theory I.   Which raises for me the question:


  Are there any serious applications of the truth of Brauer's lifting theorem when the fields involved don't contain enough roots of unity?


One has to keep in mind here that irreducible representations of a finite group over a field can be much larger in dimension than those over a splitting field.

89915,"Recently there is some interest in the Poisson geometry of ""cluster manifolds"" which are varieties associated to cluster algebras. See for example the works of Gekhtman Shapiro and Vainshtein. In this sprite Fock-Goncharov invented a ""higer TeichmÃ¼ller theory"" a crucial point of which can be roughly described as follows:

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the real flag manifold consisting of flags $\mathbb{RP}^m$ take $N\geq 3$ and let $U\subset\mathcal{F}^N$ be the set of $N$-tuples of flags in general position. So $\mathcal{X}=U/\mbox{PGL}_m(\mathbb{R})$ is a ""configurations space of flags"". Fock and Goncharov gave explicit construction of many birational maps from the algebraic torus of certain dimension to $\mathcal{X}$ which can be considered as coordinate systems of $\mathcal{X}$. They proved that the transitions between these coordinate systems are provided by certain explicit birational functions call ""mutations"". They also defined a natural Poisson structure on $\mathcal{X}$ independent of the choice of coordinates.

It would be useful for my purpose if there is an alternative construction of the Poisson structure on $\mathcal{X}$ without using the cluster coordinates for example does it comes from a ""Poisson reduction""? To make it precise we can ask:


  Is there some natural Poisson structures on $U$ for which the action of the Poisson Lie group $PGL_m(\mathbb{R})$ is a Poisson action? Moreover does it pass to the quotient to define a Poisson structure on $\mathcal{X}$?


Here I take the standard Poisson-Lie structure on $PGL_m(\mathbb{R})$ i.e. defined by a $r$-matrix whose symmetric part is the Casimir element.

Then my question is that given
$$
\mathbf{x}_i^\top A\mathbf{x}_i=a_i\forall i
$$
how to estimate the bound of the eigenvalues of $A$?

Using eigenvalue decomposition $A=U\Lambda U^\top$ and let $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i=U^\top\mathbf{x}_i$ this question can be simplified as to estimate the bound of the elements of the diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ given 
$$
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i^\top\Lambda\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i=a_i\forall i.
$$
Since $U$ is orthogonal we also have $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i\bot\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_j\forall i\neq j$ and $\|\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i\|=1$.

Denote $\Lambda=\mathrm{diag}[\lambda_1\;\ldots\;\lambda_d]^\top$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i=[\tilde{x}_{i1}\;\ldots\;\tilde{x}_{id}]$ the equations above can be represented as
$$
\sum_j\lambda_j\tilde{x}_{ij}^2=a_i\forall i
$$

However this question seems to be not so simple yet.

In the case of $d=2$ I found the following method to solve it.

Denote $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_1=[\cos\theta\;\sin\theta]^\top$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_2=[-\sin\theta\;\cos\theta]^\top$ we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_1\cos^2\theta+\lambda_2\sin^2\theta&amp;=&amp;a_1\\
\lambda_1\sin^2\theta+\lambda_2\cos^2\theta&amp;=&amp;a_2
\end{eqnarray}
Solve the equation system and we get
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_1&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{\Delta}(a_1\cos^2\theta-a_2\sin^2\theta)
=\frac{a_1-a_2\tan^2\theta}{1-\tan^2\theta}=a_2+\frac{a_1-a_2}{1-\tan^2\theta}\\
\lambda_2&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{\Delta}(-a_1\sin^2\theta+a_2\cos^2\theta)
=\frac{-a_1\tan^2\theta+a_2}{1-\tan^2\theta}=a_1-\frac{a_1-a_2}{1-\tan^2\theta}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta=\cos^4\theta-\sin^4\theta=\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta$.

Without loss of generality assume that $a_1\geq a_2$ and $\lambda_1>\lambda_2$ we can deduce that $1-\tan^2\theta>0$ then from $\lambda_i\geq 0$ we have
$$\tan^2\theta\leq\min\{\frac{a_2}{a_1}\frac{a_1}{a_2}\}=\frac{a_2}{a_1}$$
Therefore it is obvious that when $\tan^2\theta=\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ take its maximum and minimum respectively as
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_1&amp;=&amp;a_1+a_2\\
\lambda_2&amp;=&amp;0
\end{eqnarray}
and we get the bound of the eigenvalues of $A$.

However how to solve the problem if $d\geq3$?

89950,"Is it true that the length spectrum of a compact Riemannian manifold determines its volume?

This question was inspired by the MO question http://mathoverflow.net/questions/89882/length-spectrum-of-spheres . BS's answer recalls a theorem of Duistermaat and Guillemin (Duistermaat J. J.; Guillemin V. W. (1975) ""The spectrum of positive elliptic operators and periodic bicharacteristics"" Inventiones Mathematicae 29 (1): 39â79) that states that for generic metrics the length spectrum and the spectrum of the Laplacian determine each other. Since Weyl's asymptotic formula implies that the spectrum of the Laplacian determines the volume it may seem that the length spectrum determines the volume. Is this right? 

Addendum.
This question seems more useful interesting and useful if it is reformulated as follows: what does the set of lengths of periodic geodesics and/or its various analogues such as the length spectrum and the marked length spectrum say about the volume of a compact Riemannian or Finsler manifold?

Here are more concrete questions around this topic:

1. Let $M$ be a simply-connected compact $n$-manifold. Does there exist a quantity $c(M) > 0$ such that for any Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ the volume of $(Mg)$ is bounded below by $c(M)$ times the $n$-th power of the length of the shortest periodic geodesic of $(Mg)$? 

This is a really hard open problem. It was solved by Croke for the $2$-sphere in 
Area and the length of the shortest closed geodesic J. Differential Geom. Volume 27 Number 1 (1988) 1-21. The current record for $c(S^2)$ is held by Rotman: 
The length of a shortest closed geodesic and the area of a -dimensional sphere Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134 (2006) 3041-3047. However the conjectured optimal constant $1/2\sqrt{3}$
is still a challenge. 

2. Are there known (explicit?) examples of compact Riemannian manifolds with the same set of lengths of periodic geodesics (the length set) and different volume?

BS gave a reference (see his answer) where Huber shows that two compact hyperbolic surfaces with the same length spectrum have the same laplace spectrum and hence the same volume. For negatively curved compact surfaces J.-P. Otal showed that the marked length spectrum determines the surface up to isometries. This is not true for Finsler metrics (they are much more flexible than Riemannian metrics) however:

3. If two negatively-curved compact Finsler surfaces have the same marked spectrum do they also have the same area?

However posing these type of question is easy. I'm more interested in collecting some success stories.

Now to get the actual surface area we increase the number of points so that they ""densely cover"" the surface (Maybe a good working definition would be that any open set of S should eventually contain some vertexes of triangles).

89993,"I asked this question a week ago over on math.stackexchange and got no reply so I am asking here with slightly different wording.  I am trying to prove that there exists a solution to a problem.  I can't solve this problem in general but I can always continuously vary the parameters of the general problem to turn it into a specific case which is easy to solve.  I believe that the solution of the easy problem can then be varied continuously to be a solution to the hard problem.

It seems to me that this would be a widely used technique but I haven't seen it before and I don't know how to prove that it works.  To be specific suppose that $g:\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
I have a solution $x_0$ to $g(x_0 t=0)=0$.  I desire to show the existence of a solution
to $g(x_1 t=1)=0$.  My strategy is to take the known solution $x_0$ and vary it
from $t=0$ to $t=1$.
What I need is a theorem of the following form:



Suppose $g(x_0 t=0)=0$ and suppose that $\exists f$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx}{dt}=f(xt) \implies \frac{dg(xt)}{dt}=0
\end{equation}
with $x$ a function of $t$.
If $f$ and $g$ are ""well behaved enough"" in the vicinity $|g(xt)| &lt; \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$ then $\exists x$ such that $g(x1)=0$.



$f$ and $g$ in my case are ""well behaved enough"" that I can probably prove just about any sort of continuity condition that is needed.  What properties of $f$ and $g$ are needed and what theorem
will help me here?  It looks like Picard-Lindelof may help but it seems to only give
the existence of a unique solution to the differential equation and I need to show that
that solution satisfies $g(x_1 t=1)=0$.  Furthermore $f$ is not well behaved when $g$ is far from zero and so it seems I cannot use Picard-Lindelof without prior assumption that $g(xt)$ stays small (which is kind of assumes the fact that I am trying to prove).

89996,"It is striking that some q-analogs of functions operators identities and especially whole theorems seem quite ""canonical"" e.g.


the factorial and the q-Gamma function
the basic hypergeometric series (at least $_{r+1}\Phi_r$ and $_{r}\Psi_r$)
q-Pi and the q-Wallis formula


In a strict sense q-analogs can of course not be canonical as we might throw in almost everywhere powers of $q$ without changing the limit if $q\to1$.  


  I mean canonical in the sense that these are the forms that require the least extra powers of $q$ or more importantly that other q-identities/theorems using them also tend to avoid such extra powers at best making the formulae shorter.



Does it really make sense to call these (and certain other) q-analogs ""canonical""? And if so is there an explanation why some are much more canonical than others?


(Or is there a better definition of canonical?)

The canonicity of the q-binomial coefficients is obviously accounted for by their relationship with linear subspaces. (So this is not an analytical criteria using the limit $q\to1$.) 

What about the q-Gamma function? We may consider it canonical because of the (?!) q-analogue of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem proved by R. Askey which states that for $0\lt q\lt 1$ the only logarithmically convex function satisfying $f(1)=1$ and $f(x+1)=\frac{q^x â1}{qâ1}f(x)$ is the q-gamma function 
$ \Gamma_q(z)=(1-q)^{1-x}  \frac{(q\;;\; q)_{\infty}}{{(q^x;\; q) _\infty }}.$

Also note that this formula looks at least as elegant as Euler's definition of $\Gamma(z)= \dfrac{1}{z} \prod\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^z}{1+\frac{z}{n}}.$ 

On the other hand one of the most basic identities the recursion of binomial coefficients has only an ""asymmetric"" q-analog and thus two of them:
${\genfrac[]00{n}{k}}_q=q^k{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k}}_q+{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k-1}}_q={\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k}}_q+q^{n-k}{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k-1}}_q$.

For the classical orthogonal polynomials it looks like there exist systematically ""nice"" q-analogs (see e.g. this survey) but it is not clear if there is a certain sense in which those can be considered canonical. Maybe for the Chebyshev polynomials there is one ""best"" q-analog.


Is there a reasonable way of considering certain q-analogs of orthogonal polynomials ""canonical"" e.g. their uniqueness w.r.t. to an appropriate criteria as for most classical orthogonal polynomials?
Has a q-analog of a polynomial identity (e.g. involving binomial coefficients) more chances of being canonical if it has a combinatorial interpretation?


For the q-derivative there are at least two completely different approaches both with their merits. So there is no use looking for canonicity there.
But nevertheless the next question:


Are q-analogs conceptually similar to an extension from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb C$?


By the latter I mean the following:
I wonder if generally speaking the shift from an entity to its q-analog(s) can be likened at least sometimes to the shift of passing from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb C$ in the sense that some q-analogs provide a more complete picture than the entity itself (cp. for the $\mathbb R\to\mathbb C$ case the fundamental theorem of algebra or the meromorphic extension of the zeta function)?  


Many features in $\mathbb C$ e.g. the residue theorem cannot be reduced to $\mathbb R$. Likewise for example identities of ""infinite q-polynomials"" (i.e. of generating functions) cannot be taken to the limit $q\to1$.
In situations where there are several useful q-analogs e.g. for the q-exponential function or the q-cosine we might consider those corresponding to different panes of a Riemann surface like the one of $\sqrt{z}$ or $\ln z$.
And we can take it further:
The next step after $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb C$ are the quaternions.
The next step after q-analogs are pq-analogs. It looks like they haven't been studied a lot yet. 


Thank you for reading me so far.
Some of the questions may be rather subjective. As for the title I had thought at first about ""Why are most q-analogues canonical?"" But then I figured that in the whole ocean of q-analogues maybe there are just some ""very"" canonical islands but for the vast majority the notion of canonicity is more or less fuzzy. Is that a feasible perception?
Even though some of these thoughts are somewhat philosopical anyway here goes. Looking forward to your input!

here is the question:

My guess is ""no"" for the following reason (and this is basically where the question came from): in Semigroup Theory there is a notion of Rees index -- for a subsemigroup $T$ in a semigroup $S$ the Rees index is just $|S\setminus T|$. The thing is that group index and Rees index share the same features: say for almost all classical finiteness conditions $\mathcal{P}$ which make sense both for groups and semigroups the passage of $\mathcal{P}$ to sub- or supergroups of finite index holds if and only if this passage holds for sub- or supersemigroups of finite Rees index. There are also some other cases of analogy between the indices. Now the question from the post is ""no"" for Rees index in the semigroup case so I wonder if the same is true for the groups.

Edit. To answer Geoff's comment. If $A$ is a normal matrix then $r(A)=\rho(A)$ (the numerical range is the convex envelop of the spectrum in this case). But if $A$ is not normal one usually have (not always) $r(A)>\rho(A)$. Thus not all matrices with spectral radius equal to $1$ belong to $B_{\rm nr}$.

\exp(-|\xi|^a)\qquad a>1.
$$

I checked the book ""Tables of Integral Transform V.I"" (Erdelyi). There are only cases that $a=1$ and $a=2$. This is related to the symmetric stable law. 

Thank you very much for your hints and help!

$(*):$ the group $\mathrm{Aut}_V(F_n) \le \mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ whose elements fix each element of $F_n$ mod $V$ acts transitively on the set of all primitive elements from the coset $xV$ of a primitive element $x$ of $F_n.$

I have two questions related to the situation above. 

1) Is the property $(*)$ true for the verbal subgroups $V=V([x_1\ldotsx_m])=\gamma_m(F_n)$ i.e. for terms of the lower cenral series of $F_n?$ (Asked this question on math.stackexchange got no answers). 

Most likely the answer to 1) is affirmative and might be obtained from the classic description of the generators of the group $\mathrm{IA}(F_n)$ of IA-automorphisms of $F_n$ due to Magnus. I just don't see how and being not versed in German I am not able to read the original Magnus' proof. Any comments on the plan etc. of Magmus' proof are welcome. 

2) Are there examples of verbal subgroups $V$ for which the property $(*)$ is not true?

90055,"Let $X$ be a scheme. Consider the global section functor $\Gamma : \mathrm{Qcoh}(X) \to \mathrm{Ab}$. It is well-known that $\Gamma$ preserves filtered colimits if $X$ is assumed to be quasi-compact and quasi-separated. In other words $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a compact object. Even more it can be shown (using the results of EGA I 6.9) that compact objects are precisely the quasi-coherent modules which are locally of finite presentation. If we define a locally finitely presentable tensor category to be a tensor category $C$ whose underlying category is locally finitely presentable and such that a) $1_C$ is compact b) the compact objects are closed under $\otimes_C$ then $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ turns out to be such a category.

Does the converse also hold? This would be a categorical interpretation of this typical finiteness condition in algebraic geometry.

Question. When $\Gamma$ preserves filtered colimits does it follow that $X$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated? If not what if we even assume that $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ is a locally finitely presentable tensor category?

There are other natural conditions which might imply that $X$ is qc+qs for example that even all cohomology functors $H^i : \mathrm{Qcoh}(X) \to \mathrm{Ab}$ preserve filtered colimits. Besides there are relative versions of this question: When $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism of schemes then $f$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated iff $f_*$ or $f^*$ has which property?

EDIT: Let us spell out what it means that $\Gamma$ preserves direct sums: Let $M_i$ be (infinitely many) quasi-coherent modules on $X$ $s_i \in \Gamma(M_i)$ global sections and $X = \cup_j X_j$ an arbitrary open covering then the following holds: If for every $j$ we have $s_i |_{X_j} = 0$ for almost all $i$ then $s_i = 0$ for almost all $i$. So the bounds for the $i$ with $s_i \neq 0$ on each $X_j$ are bounded. Why should this happen for a scheme which is not quasi-compact? But in order to prove this we would have to construct appropriate quasi-coherent modules and this can only be done my transfinite methods if $X$ is general (see for example here).

http://mathoverflow.net/questions/89439/non-residually-finite-matrix-groups

Question. Are there infinitely generated simple discrete subgroups of $SL(n {\mathbb R})$ $n\ge 3$?

Note: Infinitely generated means not admitting a finite generating set. 

Background: By Malcev's theorem every finitely generated matrix group is residually finite. In particular it is either finite or non-simple. On the other hand there are (say countable) simple matrix groups like $PSL(n {\mathbb Q})$. The question is what happens in the case of discrete infinitely generated groups. On one hand arguments similar to Malcev's appear to fail since there are discrete non-residually finite subgroups of $SO(31)$ see Agol's examples in http://mathoverflow.net/questions/89439/non-residually-finite-matrix-groups

Moreover as Ian observes one can construct groups like this which have no nontrivial finite quotients. However an easy ping-pong argument shows the following:

Lemma.  There are no simple discrete infinite subgroups $\Gamma$ in rank 1 Lie groups. 

Proof. The statement is clear if $\Gamma$ is free so suppose that it is not. Take a high power of a hyperbolic element in $\Gamma$ then its normal closure in $\Gamma$ will be free and hence a proper normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. If $\Gamma$ has no hyperbolic elements then it is virtually nilpotent and hence not simple. 

This argument however will fail miserably for discrete subgroups in Lie groups of rank $\ge 2$ since the latter contain irreducible lattices $\Gamma$. Such lattices (by Margulis' normal subgroups theorem) contain no infinite normal subgroups of infinite index. Of course Margulis' argument will not work for infinitely generated groups but the point is that any proof of non-simplicity of discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of higher rank Lie groups would have to use the fact that $\Gamma$ is not a lattice. (The only way to exploit this fact that I can see at this point is that an infinitely generated group $\Gamma$ does not have Property (T) but it is unclear to me how to use this even to get started on proving non-simplicity.) 

So maybe there are simple infinite discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups $G$. The problem is that there are not that many ways to construct discrete infinitely generated subgroups in such $G$'s. I know only of two reasonably general constructions: 


Some form of ping-pong (used for instance by Margulis and Soifer to construct maximal subgroups of matrix groups). However the resulting groups will be free products so never simple.
Vinberg's theorem on discreteness of groups generated by linear reflections in faces of convex ""polyhedral"" cones (such cones would have to have infinitely many faces in our situation so polyhedrality has to be taken with the grain of salt). Of course Coxeter groups one obtains as the result are not simple but the only obvious normal subgroup is of index 2 so maybe one can obtain a virtually simple group (i.e. a group containing a simple subgroup of finite index) in this fashion. Could Coxeter groups with finite-dimensional Davis complex be virtually simple? Hard to imagine but at this point this seems to be the best hope for an example of a discrete infinite simple matrix group. 


Update: Actually one can show that (infinite) discrete Coxeter subgroups of Lie groups are never virtually simple. Even more any discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $SL(n {\mathbb R})$ which contains an abstract rank 1 diagonalizable element is never virtually simple (same proof as in the case of rank 1 Lie groups works). Here abstract rank 1 element of an (abstract) group $\Gamma$ is an infinite order element $\gamma$ so that for any $k\ne 0$ the centralizer of $\gamma^k$ in $\Gamma$ is virtually cyclic with uniform bound in ""virtually."" So maybe one can show that all discrete Zariski dense subgroups of $SL(n {\mathbb R})$ without abstract rank 1 elements are lattices by running some Margulis-type argument...

90062,"Let A be a $C^*$-algebra with unit $I$ and G a locally compact (Hausdorff) group. An action $\alpha$ of G on A is a strongly continuous homomorphism of G into Aut(A) the group of *-automorphisms of A. We say that $\alpha$ is ergodic if the elements $\lambda I$ with $\lambda$ any complex number are the only elements invariant under $\alpha$.

If A is commutative i.e. $A\cong C(X)$ where $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space (the spectrum of A) giving an action $\alpha$ on A is equivalent to giving an action $\phi$ of $G$ on the spectrum by homeomorphisms where for any $f\in C(X)$ we have
$$(\alpha_g (f))=f(\phi_g^{-1}(x))\quad \forall x\in X$$

(1) is the strong continuity of $g\mapsto\alpha_g$ equivalent to continuity of the map $g\mapsto\phi_g$ if we endow the set of homeomorphisms:$X\rightarrow X$ with the compact-open topology?

It is easy that under the assumption $G$ compact ergodicity is equivalent to transitivity of the action $\phi$ on the spectrum X (using the averaging operator) but

(2) what can we say about ergodicity in the case where $G$ is just locally compact (and Hausdorff)? Is ergodicity of $\alpha$ equivalent to 'topological' ergodicity i.e. the only open (equivalently closed) subsets invariant for $\phi$ are X and $\emptyset$

If we have non-constant invariant functions on $X$ then the pre-image of a value taken is a proper invariant closed of $X$ but what about the other implication?

90067,"The general form of the  Local Lemma can be stated as follows:


  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of events in a probability space. For $A \in \mathcal{A}$ let $\Gamma(A)$ be a subset of $\mathcal{A}$ such that $A$ is independent of the collection of events in $\mathcal{A} \setminus ({A} \cup \Gamma(A))$. If there exists an assignment of
  reals $x : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow (01)$ such that $\forall A \in \mathcal{A}$:
  $$\text{Pr}(A) \leq x(A)  \Pi_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B))$$
  Then the probability of avoiding all the events in $\mathcal{A}$ is positive. 


Recently Moser and Tardos produced a proof of the Local Lemma which provides a random algorithm which produces the point in the probability space which avoids all the events in $\mathcal{A}$ and under the hypotheses of the lemma has fast expected runtime. In the same paper they provide a parallel algorithm and the following theorem:


  Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a finite set of mutually independent random variables in a probability space. and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of events determined by $\mathcal{P}$. Let $\varepsilon >0$. If there exists an assignment of reals $x : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow (01)$ such that $\forall A \in \mathcal{A}$:
  $$\text{Pr}(A) \leq(1 - \varepsilon) x(A)  \Pi_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B))$$
  then the parallel algorithm takes an expected $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ log $\sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}}$ $\frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)})$ steps before it finds an evaluation of the variables
  in $\mathcal{P}$ which violates no variable in $\mathcal{A}$. 


Here is a link to the paper where they prove this result. 

I am working through the analysis of the parallel algorithm and I appear to have hit a snag. At the bottom of page 7 in the linked paper the authors introduce $Q(k)$ the probability that the algorithm takes at least $k$ steps. Then the bound
$$ Q(k) \leq (1-\varepsilon)^k \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)}$$
is established. This is the point where I get a little lost. The claim is that the theorem follows easily from this bound. If someone could help me see how the theorem follows from the bound that would be quite helpful! I have noted a few  points that I believe are key:

-This probability $Q(k)$ seems to not actually be the probability that the parallel algorithm takes at least $k$ steps. Instead it seems to be the probability that the sequential algorithm takes at least $k$ steps if we view the parallel algorithm as an instance of the sequential algorithm. This is explained in the opening paragraph of section 4.

-If $Q(k)$ is the probability that the sequential algorithm takes at least $k$ steps then $Q(k) - Q(k+1)$ is the probability that the algorithm takes exactly $k$ steps. Taking expectation we get that the expected number of steps is $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty kQ(k) - kQ(k+1)$. This sum telescopes leaving us with $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty Q(k)$. Applying the bound on $Q(k)$ we see that the expectation here is upper bounded by $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)})$. Somehow the ""parallelization"" of this algorithm gets that log in the desired claim. 

So the particular question is how does the parallelization introduce the logarithm into the expected number of steps taken by the parallel algorithm?

  $$\sum_{\substack{n \leq X \ n \equiv a \mod q}} \Lambda(n) \gg_q \frac{X}{\varphi(q)} $$
  (the factor $\varphi (q)$ is introduced here only for cosmetic reasons)


There are basically two ways in which this could be strenghtened : 


for fixed $q$ in the $X$-aspect : this amounts to replace the $\gg $ above by $\sim$ which is exactly the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions.
in the $q$-aspect : one asks for explicit $\epsilon$ (depending on $q$) satisfying
$$\sum_{\substack{n \leq X \ n \equiv a \mod q}} \Lambda(n) \geq \epsilon \frac{X}{\varphi(q)} $$


If complex analysis is allowed the Siegel-Walfisz solves both problems and gives $\epsilon =  1 - o(1)$ in the range $q \ll \left( \log X \right) ^A $ (for any $A>0$). But I'm especially interested in elementary methods (with the usual meaning of the word ""elementary"" in this context). Following step by step Dirichlet's proof (or at least one of its modern variants) I managed to prove that
$$ \epsilon = e^{- C \varphi(q) \left( \log q \right)^9} $$
is admissible. Apart from the unimportant $\log$ factors I haven't improved this yet. Hence my questions :


  What is the best (known) lower bound on $\epsilon$ that one can reach by elementary methods ?
  
  What is the wider allowed range for $q$ that one gets from the elementary proofs of the prime number in arithmetic progressions  ? 


References are welcome I've found none so far.

EDIT : In view of the comments and answers below I conclude that what I'm asking for is not as classic I thought it was. I summarize the state of the question :


there are (relatively easy and) elementary proofs of Siegel's theorem but deducing from it a Siegel-Walfisz theorem seems to require complex (or Fourier) analysis.
No elementary proof of Linnik's theorem exists in the literature but Micah Milinovich suggests below that A. Granville could have further information on this subject. It may be worth contacting him.


EDIT 2 : My questions are essentially solved by the ""anonymous's"" comment below. There indeed exists an elementary proof of Linnik's theorem (or at least a proof avoiding most of the complex analysis machinery in original Linnik's proof). The last use of complex analysis originated results lies in the explicit use of $\Psi(Xqa) = \frac{X-\frac{X^{\beta}}{\beta}}{\varphi(q)} + \text{Error term}$ (according to Andrew Granville this seems to be fixed but details are not clear

90082,"I was looking again at the beautiful and quite complete work of DieudonnÃ© his Treatise of Analysis to refresh my memory about some aspects of classical analysis. I especially love this Treatise for the quality of its exercises. Unfortunately some of them are marred with plain mistakes or wrong hints and make me waste a lot of time detecting all of them. Does anybody know a reliable errata for the nine volumes of this treatise or at least volume 23 and 4 ?

Here below are two instances of plain wrong hints in an exercise and a sketch of a solution I found for each of them. 

I would very much appreciate if somebody could give some kind of reassurance that I am on the right track here and that my solutions are correct.

Here is the text of the first exercise:


The hint is obviously wrong because it is not possible to have the inequality $b\mu(A\cap F_q)\leq a\mu(A)$ for $q=n$ for instance.

Below is a solution I found for comments

Notation for $p\geq n\geq 0$ :

$$\begin{align*}
A_{n}^p &amp;=\left\{x\in X\ ;\ \sup_{p\geq r\geq n}f_{r}(x)\geq b\right\} \\
B_{n}^p &amp;=\left\{x\in X\ ;\ \inf_{p\geq r\geq n}f_{r}(x)\leq a\right\} \\
\end{align*}$$

and

$$\begin{alignat*}{2}
A_{n} &amp;=\bigcup_{p\geq n} A_{n}^p &amp;\quad B_{n} &amp;=\bigcup_{p\geq n} B_{n}^p \\
A &amp;=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}A_{n} &amp;\quad B &amp;=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}B_{n}
\end{alignat*}$$

Then we have $E_{ab}=A\cap B$. We also note that the unions and intersections in the previous definitions are respectively increasing and decreasing sequences.

Choose $r\geq s\geq p\geq q\geq m\geq n$.
First we notice that $$A_{n}^m = \bigcup_{m\geq i\geq n} \left\{x\in X\ ;\ f_{n}(x)&lt;b \cdots f_{i-1}(x)&lt;b\ f_{i}(x)\geq b\right\}$$ the union being of disjoints sets.
By definition of a martingale for $i\leq m$ we have $$\int_{x\in X\ ;\ f_n(x)&lt;\cdotsf_{iâ1}(x)&lt;b\ f_i(x\geq b} f_i\ d\mu=\int_{x\in X\ ;\ f_n(x)&lt;\cdotsf_{iâ1}(x)&lt;b\ f_i(x\geq b}f_m\ d\mu$$
Then we get $$\int_{A_n^m}f_{m}d\mu \geq b\mu(A_{n}^m)$$
For the same reasons we also get $$\int_{B_{n}^m}f_{m}d\mu \leq a\mu(B_{n}^m)$$

Therefore we deduce that $$\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r}f_{r} d\mu \geq b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r)$$
and $$\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r}f_{r}d\mu \leq \int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p}f_{r}d\mu =\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p}f_{p}d\mu \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p) \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q})$$

Let $$b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r) \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q})$$

By successively having $r$ then $s$ then $p$ then $q$ goes towards infinity we get $$b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B \cap A)\leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B)$$
If $m$ then $n$ goes towards infinity we get $$b\mu(E_{ab})\leq a\mu(E_{ab})$$ QEA.

Here is the text of the second example of wrong hint in an exercise 



and a solution I found

Firstly here is a counterexample for the impossibility to build a sequence $(B_{n})$ as suggested in the book:
For $k\geq 1$ et $0\leq n&lt; 2^k$ let $J_{n}^k=[n2^{-k}(n+1)2^{-k}]$. We take for $n\geq 0$ : $$A_{n}=\bigcup_{j\in 2N 0\leq j&lt;2^{n+1}}J_{j}^{n+1}$$
Then $n\geq 0$ $\lambda(A_{n})=\frac{1}{2}$ et $I_{n}=I$. We rightly have $r\geq n$ and $J_{j}^n \subset I_{n}$ $\lambda(A_{r}\cap J_{j}^n)=\frac{1}{2}\lambda(J_{j}^n)$.

But for all subsequences $(A_{n_{k}})$ we get $$\bigcap_{k\geq0}A_{n_{k}}\cap J_{1}^{n_{0}+1}\subset A_{n_{0}}\cap J_{1}^{n_{0}+1}=\emptyset$$

Proof of the main result

For the proof of the main result we set $D=\cap_{k\geq 1}I_{k}$ and we notice that $\lambda(D)\geq \frac{1}{2}m$ 
and for $r\geq n\geq 0$ we get $\lambda(A_{r}\cap I_{n})\geq \frac{1}{4}m^2$. 

We then use the following lemma

If $C\subset D$ is a compact of measure $r>0$ then for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ there exist $k>0$ and a $J_{n}^k \subset D_k$ such as 
$$\lambda(C\cap J_{n}^k) > \alpha \lambda(J_{n}^k) \quad (*)$$
where $D_k$ here corresponds to the $D_k$ in text of the exercise. 

Proof of the lemma

Cover $C$ by $N$ non-empty open disjoint intervals $(U_{i})$ with $1\leq i\leq n$ such that $$r\leq \sum_{i}\lambda(U_{i}) &lt; r+\epsilon$$
For  $k$ big enough (for example such as $2^{-k}$ is smaller than half the smallest length of the intervals $(U_{i})$) let $$V_{k}={0\leq n&lt; 2^k ; \exists 1\leq i\leq N \quad J_{n}^k\subset U_{i}}$$
Then we get $$0\leq \sum_{1\leq i\leq N}\lambda(U_{i}) -\sum_{n\in V_{k}} \lambda(J_{n}^k) &lt; 2^{-k+1}N$$ and $$0\leq \sum_{n\in V_{k}} \lambda(J_{n}^k) -\sum_{n\in V_{k}} \lambda(J_{n}^k\cap C)&lt; \epsilon$$
If the lemma were false then we have $$r\leq \sum_{1\leq i\leq N}\lambda(U_{i}) &lt; 2^{-k+1}N+\epsilon+\alpha\sum_{n\in V_{k}} \lambda(J_{n}^k)\leq 2^{-k+1}N+\epsilon+\alpha\sum_{1\leq i\leq N}\lambda(U_{i})$$ soit $$(1-\alpha)r\leq  2^{-k+1}N+(1+\alpha)\epsilon$$ which is absurd as soon as $k$ is big enough and $\epsilon$ small enough.  

This lemma has the following consequences


we always have $J_{n}^k\subset I_{k}$
as soon as $k'>k$ we can choose a $J_{n}^{k'}$ in $I_{k'}$ which fulfills $(*)$ and such as $J_{n}^{k'}\subset J_{n}^k$
with $\alpha$ close enough to $1$ we get as soon as $r\geq k$ $$\lambda(C\cap A_{r}\cap J_{n}^k)>0$$ 
if $k$ is big enough using again the lemma for $C\cap (I-J_{n}^k)$ we see we can get the previous inequality in two disjoint closed intervals after a certain rank $k'>k$.


The proof is then not too difficult to finish by a recurrence building disjoint sequences of decreasing  intervals of the type $J_{n}^k$ for which intersections are the points of $I$ but I lack space to write it in detail !

If $\ell$ is a prime $\neq p$ then $T_\ell(E)$ is identified with $T_\ell(E_\mathfrak{p})$ in a natural way by the good reduction of $E$. As it turns out such a Galois representation is determined up to isomorphism by the characteristic polynomial $f_{E_\mathfrak{p}}(x)=x^2-a_{E_\mathfrak{p}}x+|k_\mathfrak{p}|$ associated to $E_\mathfrak{p}$ and by $j_E$ mod $\mathfrak{p}=j_{E_\mathfrak{p}}$ UNLESS we are in the following (very) ${\it special}$ case:

$p\equiv 3$ mod $4$; $|k_\mathfrak{p}|=p^{2m+1}$; $a_{E_\mathfrak{p}}=0$; $\ell=2$; and $j_E\equiv 1728$ mod $\mathfrak{p}$.

If the first three conditions hold then $E_\mathfrak{p}$ is supersingular and its endomorphisms ring over $k_\mathfrak{p}$ is ""only"" isomorphic to an order in $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ containing $\sqrt{-p}$ and thus isomorphic to either $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{-p}]$ or to $\mathbf{Z}[(1+\sqrt{-p})/2]$. The second case occurs precisely when all the two torsion is defined over $k_\mathfrak{p}$ the first case when $E_\mathfrak{p}[2]$ has only two $k_\mathfrak{p}$-points. Both cases do arise and give rise to non-isomorphic $T_2(E_\mathfrak{p})$.

Essentially by Deuring's Lifting Lemma one can decide which of the two possibilities occurs by looking at the $j$-invariant of $E_\mathfrak{p}$ UNLESS this is equal to 1728. The point is that if $j_{E_\mathfrak{p}}\neq 1728$ then the two $k_\mathfrak{p}$-forms of $E_\mathfrak{p}\otimes_{k_\mathfrak{p}}\bar k_\mathfrak{p}$ lying in the $k_\mathfrak{p}$-isogeny class $a_{E_\mathfrak{p}}=0$ have the same ring of endomorphisms over $k_\mathfrak{p}$ out of the two possibilities listed above. The opposite being true when $j_{E_\mathfrak{p}}=1728$ (this fact is very related to the analysis of the mod $p$ reduction of Hilbert Class Polynomials associated to discriminants $-p$ and $-4p$ done by Gross and Elkies (cf. $\S 2$ Proposition in Elkies' ""The existence of infinitely many supersingular primes for every elliptic curve over $\mathbf{Q}$"" Inventiones 89 (1987))).

In other words in the special case the pair $(f_{E_{\mathfrak{p}}}(x) j_E$ mod $\mathfrak{p})$ does ${\it not}$ determine $T_2(E_\mathfrak{p})$.

Here is the question then: in the special case can we determine what is the endomorphism ring of $E_\mathfrak{p}$ (and hence $T_2(E)$) from congruences of $j_E$ mod a higher power of $\mathfrak{p}$ (or of $p$)?

It is not even clear to me whether this should be possible let alone what power of $p$ we would need to tell one case from the other.

90092,"This is about the frequency of integral solutions to
$$  b^2 - 4 a^3 = \Delta  $$
when $\Delta &lt; 0$ is a discriminant of positive binary quadratic forms such that the class number is divisible by 3. My observation is that integral solutions are pretty frequent when $|\Delta|$ is small. For instance there are 25 discriminants with class number exactly 3. Of these in 19 cases we can write the non-principal order three form as $$ \langle a \pm b a^2  \rangle  $$ the failures seeming to be $$ \Delta = -124 \; -172 \; -307 \; -547 \; -652 \; 907$$ with the first two proved impossible in integers maybe all six.

Note that there may be multiple solutions for a given $\Delta$ which usually means the forms reduce to the same thing or the principal form as in
$$  \langle 2 1 4  \rangle =  \langle 4 15 16  \rangle   $$  but
$$   \langle 10 63 100  \rangle =   \langle 1 1 8  \rangle. $$ 
On the other hand in the relatively rare event of 3-rank larger than one we may have genuinely distinct cube roots of 1 and for $\Delta = -3299$  we find
$$   \langle 1145 121  \rangle =   \langle 11 1 75  \rangle $$
$$   \langle 15 101 225  \rangle =   \langle 15 11 57  \rangle $$
$$   \langle 23 213 529  \rangle =   \langle 23 -17 39  \rangle. $$ 

So the question is how likely is it that a positive form of order three in the class group can be written as
$$ f(xy) = a x^2 + b x y + a^2 y^2 ?  $$

EDIT: of course this becomes Mordell's equation when $\Delta$ is even which is how I know there are proofs for $-124 -172$ but a rational solution $a = 1177/36 \; b = 40355/108$ for $-172.$ Hope I got the factor of 2 in the right place. 

EDIT TOOOOO: forgot. by Dirichlet's ""united forms"" description of composition 
$$   \langle aba^2  \rangle^2 =   \langle a^2 ba  \rangle $$ so such a form is either the principal form or of order three as long as $$ \gcd(ab) = 1.  $$ 

EDIT THREE Saturday: The importance of this for my other recent questions appeared when I found that $ \langle 419  \rangle$ integrally represents 77 but $ \langle 419  \rangle + \langle 419  \rangle$ or $g(xyzw) = 4 x^2 + x y + 9 y^2 + 4 z^2 + z w + 9 w^2$ does not represent $77^2 = 5929.$ Now  $ \langle 419  \rangle$ has order five so the set of values it represents is not required to be multiplicative. Similarly if $f$ is of order 2 ""ambiguous"" it seems always true that $f$ represents some $n$ (often prime) while $f(xy) + f(zw)$ fails to represent $n^2.$ Note that the original form in question 
 88905  is of order three indeed 
$$  \langle 42 3  \rangle =  \langle 3-24  \rangle  =  \langle 3-89  \rangle.  $$

Clearly any permutation of the tensor factors is in $A$. I am looking for an elementary proof that these permutations span $A$.

If $\dim V \geq n$ there is a very simple proof. Take $e_1$ $e_2$ ... $e_n$ in $V$ linearly independent and let $\alpha \in A$. Then $\alpha(e_1 \otimes e_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_n)$ must be a $t_1 t_2 \cdots t_n$ eigenvector for the action of the matrix $\mathrm{diag}(t_1 t_2 \ldots )$ in $GL(V)$. So $\alpha(e_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_n) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} c_{\sigma} e_{\sigma(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{\sigma(n)}$ for some constants $c_{\sigma}$. It is then straightforward to show that $\alpha$ is given by the corresponding linear combination of permutations.

I feel like there should be an elementary if not very well motivated extension of the above argument for the case where $\dim V &lt; n$ but I'm not finding it.

Motivation: I'm planning a course on the combinatorial side of $GL_N$ representation theory -- symmetric polynomials jdt RSK and if I can pull it off some more modern things like honeycombs and crystals. Since it will be advertised as a combinatorics course I want to prove a few key results that give the dictionary between combinatorics and representation theory and then do all the rest on the combinatorial side. Based on the lectures I have outlined so far I think this will be one of the few key results. 

The standard proof is to show that the centralizer of $k[S_n]$ is spanned by $GL(V)$ and then apply the double centralizer theorem. Although the double centralizer theorem (at least over $\mathbb{C}$) doesn't formally involve anything I won't be covering I think it is pretty hard to present it to people who aren't extremely happy with the representation theory of semi-simple algebras. So I am looking for an alternate route.

$\int_{0 \le u_1 \le \cdots \le u_j \le t} \mathrm{d}X_{u_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{d}X_{u_j}$

is exactly $\frac{1}{j!}(X_t - X_0)^{\otimes j}$.  It is assumed that $X:[0T] \to V$ is a Lipschitz path in some finite dimensional vector space $V$.

Is there a simple way to establish this fact?  Also I would be grateful for any reference on this type of integrals involving tensors since I've never encountered them before.

Further background

Integration with respect to $X$ is defined for any continuous $f: [0T] \to L(VW)$ ($W$ a finite dimensional vector space and $L(VW)$ the space of linear maps from $V$ to $W$) as:

$\int f_s \mathrm{d}X_s = \lim  \sum_{i = 0}^{r -1} f_{t_i}(X_{t_{i+1}} - X_{t_i})$

where the limit is taken over partitions $t_0 = 0 \le t_1 \le \cdots \le t_r = T$ whose largest interval is decreasing to $0$ in length.  The result belongs to the space $W$.

Hence to make the above iterated integral fit into the definition (and give a result in $V^{\otimes j}$) it seems to me that one must consider each element $w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_i \in V^{\otimes i}$ as an element of $L(V V^{\otimes i+1})$ via the map $v \mapsto w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_i \otimes v$. However after doing this I still have trouble establishing the identity.

As an example with the above interpretation I get:

$\int_{0 \le s \le t \le T} \mathrm{d}X_s \otimes \mathrm{d}X_t = \frac{1}{2}T^2 v_1\otimes v_1 + \frac{2}{3}T^3 v_1\otimes v_2 +  \frac{1}{3}T^3 v_2 \otimes v_1 + \frac{1}{2}T^4 v_2 \otimes v_2$

for $X_t = t v_1 + t^2 v_2$ in a $2$-dimensional vector space with basis $(v_1v_2)$.  This example shows that the result of the integral itself may be non-symmetric.

A large field $K$ (a.k.a. an ample field) is a field such that if $V$ is a variety of dimension $\geq 1$ over $K$ with at least one smooth $K$-rational point then it has infinitely many smooth $K$-rational points. For example any algebraically closed field is large.

A Hilbertian field is more difficult to explain but it suffices to say that any number field and any function field (over any field) is Hilbertian.

My question is:

Is there a proof (not a conjecture) that there exists a field $K$ which is neither a function field over a henselian field nor a function field over a large field nor a large Hilbertian field such that the inverse Galois problem is true over that field?

$$
{\rm Hom}(\{x_s\}\{y_t\}) = \varprojlim_t\ \varinjlim_s\ {\rm Hom}(x_sy_t).
$$
Generally this category is fairly hard to work with.  This is especially true because several types of maps of pro-objects are defined in terms of the existence of a representing map of diagrams with certain properties and it can be very difficult to rectify several distinct properties at once.

One way to describe the category of pro-objects is by inverting morphisms.  Specifically we can form a more restricted category of pairs $(IF)$ of a cofiltered index category $I$ and a diagram $F: I \to C$ with morphisms defined as pairs of a functor and a natural transformation of diagrams.  Certain maps of cofiltered diagrams become isomorphisms of pro-objects (the most important ones being reindexing along a final subcategory).  Inverting them gives us the pro-category.

In some sense this automatically provides us with a ""category with weak equivalences"" but it's intrinsically very large and it's not necessarily clear if the ""homotopy theory"" is tractable.

Are there any circumstances under which the category of diagrams in $C$ automatically has the structure of a model category with weak equivalences being pro-isomorphisms?  In these cases does the category Pro-$C$ have an interesting homotopy theory or are the mapping spaces essentially discrete?

Obviously being complete and cocomplete is going to be an obstacle to this kind of structure.  Failing that is there any further possibility of gaining control on the homotopy theory?

The result (slightly simplified) is

If $X$ is a uniformly convex space (i.e. if $||x|| = ||y|| = 1$ with $||x - y|| \geq \epsilon$ then there exists $\delta(\epsilon) > 0$ such that $||\frac{x + y}{2}|| \leq 1 - \delta(\epsilon)$) then for any $x y$ with $||x|| \leq 1$ and $||y|| \leq 1$ and $||x - y|| \geq \epsilon$  $||\frac{x + y}{2}|| \leq 1 - \delta(\epsilon)$.

Part of the problem is that I think this isn't true without making some additional restrictions to reduce the value of $\delta(\epsilon)$. e.g. by considering $||x|| = 1$ and $y = (1 - \epsilon) x$ you can see that this requires that $\delta(\epsilon) \leq \frac{1}{2} \epsilon$. So I think the true result is probably just that you can choose $\delta$ so that this is true.

90120,"Hello

this thread is a follow up from http://mathoverflow.net/questions/61842/about-goldbachs-conjecture

I actually aim at proving that the smallest typical potential primality radius of an integer $n$ written as $r_0(n)$ verifies $r_0(n)=O(\log^{2} n)$. This implies Cramer's conjecture (since if $k=\frac{p_{n+1}+p_{n}}{2}$ then one has $r_0(k)=O(\log^{2}k)$ i.e.
$g_{n}:=p_{n+1}-p_{n}=2r_{0}(k)=O(\log^{2}k)=O(\log^{2}p_{n})$. 

The relation we aim at proving is a consequence of both $\dfrac{2r_{0}(n)}{\epsilon_n}=O(1)$ and $\epsilon'_n=\epsilon_n(1+o(1))$ (where $\epsilon'_n:=\dfrac{P_{ord_{c}}(n)}{N_{1}(n)}$ and $\epsilon_n=\dfrac{P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n)}{N_{1}(n)-1}$). 

It has been established that $\dfrac{n}{\epsilon'_n}\geq \dfrac{c.n}{\log^{2} n}$ for some positive constant $c$ and $n$ large enough. From that we get $\epsilon'_n=O(\log^{2} n)$. 

First let's give a sketch of proof that $\epsilon'_n\sim\epsilon_n$:

$\dfrac{\epsilon'_n-\epsilon_n}{\epsilon_n}=\dfrac{(N_{1}(n)-1)P_{ord_{c}}(n)}{N_{1}(n)(P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n))}-1$
$=\dfrac{(N_{1}(n)-1)P_{ord_{c}}(n)}{N_{1}(n)(P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n))}-\dfrac{N_{1}(n)(P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n))}{N_{1}(n)(P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n))}$
$=\dfrac{2N_{1}(n)r_{0}(n)-P_{ord_{c}}(n)}{N_{1}(n)(P_{ord_{c}}(n)-2r_{0}(n))}$ $=-\dfrac{2N_{1}(n)r_{0}(n)-P_{ord_{c}}(n)}{2N_{1}(n)r_{0}(n)-N_{1}(n)P_{ord_{c}}(n)}$

The last quantity is modulo the minus sign $f(n):=\dfrac{2r_{0}(n)-O(\log^{2}(n))}{2r_{0}(n)-P_{ord_{c}}(n)}$. But whenever $n>13$ $N_1(n)>1$ so that $2r_{0}(n)-P_{ord_{c}}(n)$ is non zero.
Moreover as $P_{ord_{c}}(n)$ grows faster than $n$ one should have $\lim f(n)=0$ and thus $\epsilon'_n=\epsilon_n(1+o(1))$.

After some computations one gets that $\lim f(n)=0$ implies $f(n)=O(\frac{1}{N_{1}(n)})$ (because if $\epsilon_n\sim\epsilon'_n$ then $r_{0}(n)=o(P_{ord_{c}}(n))$ and using this in the expression of $f(n)$ allows to conclude). 

One can easily show that $\dfrac{2r_{0}(n)}{\epsilon_n}=N_1(n)\dfrac{\epsilon'_n-\epsilon_n}{\epsilon_n}+1$. As $f(n)=O(\frac{1}{N_{1}(n)})$ it comes $\dfrac{2r_{0}(n)}{\epsilon_n}=O(1)+1=O(1)$.

Finally: $r_{0}(n)=O(\log^{2} n)$.

My question is: can one prove rigorously that $\lim f(n)=0$?

$$

where the Einstein summation convention is applied for $j$ here and $\psi_j:S\to{\mathbb R}$ is assumed to be $C^{\infty}$. Or without normalization consider the limit
$$

The eigenfunctions of this family of operators indexed by powers of $X$ are called symmetric Jack polynomials with parameter $\alpha$.
It is well-known that Heckman-Opdam polynomials generalize Jack symmetric polynomials to other root systems. My question is are there generalizations of the Laplace-Beltrami operators to root systems as well? The operator is defined in $A_{n+1}$ up to affine transformation as
$$ D_\alpha^2 f = \frac{\alpha}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i \partial_i)^2 + \sum_{i &lt; j} \frac{x_i^2 \partial_i - x_j^2 \partial_j}{x_i - x_j}.$$

Applying this operator to power sum polynomial $p_\lambda$ has a natural random walk interpretation see the paper ""a probabilistic interpretation of Macdonald polynomials"" for detail.

Edit: I figured out that the notation $\partial_\alpha$ with respect to a weight $\alpha$ is indeed the same as $x_i \partial_i$ since the latter is differentiation with respect to maximal torus element i.e. $\partial_\alpha e^{k \alpha} = k e^{k \alpha} = \partial_{x_i} x_i^k$ if $e^\alpha = x_i$.

If anyone would point me to sources when that problem was studied or solved I would be grateful below I present what I managed  to get myself.

The formula I got is:

$\frac{\sum\limits_{i=\lceil \frac{k}{m}\rceil}^{k} i{n \choose i} \sum\limits_{h=0}^{\lfloor \frac{k-i}{m}\rfloor} (-1)^{h}{i \choose h} {k-1-hm \choose k-i-hm}}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\lfloor \frac{k}{m+1} \rfloor} (-1)^{i}{n \choose i}{n+k-1-i(l+1) \choose k-i(m+1)}} $

(By a computer program I wrote I already checked it on many input values and it always worked. Explanation of the formula (the sum limits may be largely ignored they just say outside where addends would be 0 anyway): In denominator I count all combinations that keep the max limit given. First component (for i = 0) is just a regular combination with repetition then I subtract all that have at least 1 box overfilled then I need to add those that have at least 2 box overfilled (since earlier I counted
them too many times) and so on according to inclusion-exclusion principle. In numerator situation is similar yet every time I choose just i boxes that can be used (i.e. only them can be non-empty)).

This formula can be written in a little nicer form as follows:

$\frac{\sum\limits_{i=\lceil \frac{k}{m}\rceil}^{k} i{n \choose i} \sum\limits_{h=0}^{\lfloor \frac{k-i}{m}\rfloor} (-1)^{h}{i \choose h} {k-1-hm \choose i-1}}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\lfloor \frac{k}{m+1} \rfloor} (-1)^{i}{n \choose i}{n+k-1-i(m+1) \choose n-1}}$ 

But apart from that I don't know how to convert it to a digestible (i.e. reasonably efficiently computable) one. At this point I am not considering approximating yet if someone had a good advice there I would be grateful too (approximating every binomial separately doesn't seem to be a good idea). 

Additionally those equations may help:

$\sum\limits_{i} (-1)^{i}{n \choose i}{n+k-1-i \choose n-1} = 0$


$\sum\limits_{i} (-1)^{i}{n \choose i}{n+k-1-2i \choose n-1} = {n \choose k}$


$\sum\limits_{i} (-1)^{i}{n \choose i}{n+k-1-(k+1)i \choose n-1} = {n + k -1 \choose k}$

(they come from taking the denominator and setting max limit to respectively 0 1 k which respectively means no such combinations combinations without repetition combinations with repetition. Same can be done with nominator. Those equations may be actually new since I didn't see them at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient  Knuth's ""The Art of Computer Programming"" or anywhere else that I looked up to now).

The group $\mathrm{GL}_n\left(k\right)=\mathrm{GL} V$ acts on $\mathrm{End} V$ by conjugation and thus also on the space of $s$-multilinear forms $\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^s\to k$ for each $s\in\mathbb N$.

For every $p\in\mathbb N$ and every $p$-multilinear form $f:\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^p \to k$ we define the antisymmetrization of $f$ to be the $p$-multilinear form

$g:\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^p \to k$

$\left(A_1A_2...A_p\right) \mapsto \dfrac{1}{p!}\sum\limits_{\sigma\in S_p}\left(-1\right)^{\sigma} f\left(A_{\sigma\left(1\right)}A_{\sigma\left(2\right)}...A_{\sigma\left(p\right)}\right)$.

This $g$ is an antisymmetric $p$-multilinear form.

For any integers $p\geq 0$ and $q\geq 0$ any antisymmetric $p$-multilinear form $\alpha:\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^p\to k$ and any antisymmetric $q$-multilinear form $\beta:\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^q\to k$ we can define an antisymmetric $p+q$-multilinear form $\alpha\wedge\beta:\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^{p+q}\to k$ as the antisymmetrization of the form

$\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^{p+q}\to k$

$\left(A_1A_2...A_pB_1B_2...B_q\right)\mapsto \alpha\left(A_1A_2...A_p\right)\beta\left(B_1B_2...B_q\right)$.

(We could also define it using shuffle products but that's not important in characteristic $0$.)

For any $p\in\mathbb N$ let $\Omega_p : \left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^p \to k$ be the antisymmetrization of the form

$\left(\mathrm{End} V\right)^p \to k$

$\left(A_1A_2...A_p\right)\mapsto \mathrm{Tr}\left(A_1A_2...A_p\right)$.

Then it is known that the ring of antisymmetric $\mathrm{GL}_n\left(k\right)$-invariant multilinear forms on $\mathrm{End}V$ (with multiplication being given by $\wedge$) is generated by the $\Omega_p$ for $p\in\mathbb N$ (this follows from the First Fundamental Theorem for $\mathrm{GL}_n\left(k\right)$ which actually gives all multilinear invariants rather than just the antisymmetric ones). It is also easy to see that $\Omega_p=0$ for all even $p$ and the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem yields that $\Omega_p=0$ for all $p\geq 2n$.

Thus the family $\left(\Omega_{p_1}\wedge\Omega_{p_2}\wedge ...\wedge\Omega_{p_r}\right)$ (indexed by all strictly increasing sequences $\left(p_1p_2...p_r\right)$ of odd positive integers smaller than $2n$) generates the vector space of all antisymmetric $\mathrm{GL}_n\left(k\right)$-invariant multilinear forms on $\mathrm{End}V$.

Question. How to prove that this family is a basis of this space?

Context. This is quoted as a consequence of (not further specified) invariant theory in Pierre Cartier's A primer of Hopf algebras page 9 Â§2.1.

I think that what Serre ment is that is a G-set P with two G-groups A and B such that:

$\forall pq \in P :  \exists ! a \in A  : q=a*p$

$\forall pq \in P :   \exists  !b \in B  : q=p*b$

$\forall p \in P  a \in A  b \in B: (a*p)*b=a*p*b=a*(p*b)$  (A and B action commutes)

Then he talks about composition of such spaces: if P is a (AA')-space and Q is a (A'A'')-space then

$P \circ Q = P \times ^{A'}Q $

which he claims has a (A'A'')-space structure.
If so for what is this composition is good for? Q is already a (A'A'')-space.

Serre defines $ P \times ^AF$ as follows: let A be a G-group let P be a principal homogeneous space on which A acts from the right and F a G-set on which A acts from the left. Then it is a quotient space of $P \times F$ induced by the following equivalence relation:
$ (pf) \sim (p*a a^{-1}*f) $ for all $a \in A$.

He uses the construction of biprincipal spaces and their compositions in several instances (instead of using the cocycles language) such as in the proof of Proposition 35 and in the construction of fibers for normal subgroup in page 52.

I wonder if there are some examples which I hope will give me a feel of this construction and another good text about it. Moreover translation of this biprincipal spaces to a cocycles language

given that $P \times ^AF \cong _a F$ by using a cocycle $a_s$ to twist F: $^s \prime f = a_s \cdot ^s f$ which can be defined for $p \in P$ by $ s \mapsto  a_s \mbox{ such that } ^s p = p * a_s$ and the mapping $ f \mapsto [(pf)]$ induces  $P \times ^AF \cong _a F$

To every set $X$ there corresponds a group-like coalgebra $kX$ with basis $X$. ""Grouplike"" means that there is a basis $X$ with $\epsilon(x)=1$ and $\Delta(x)=x\otimes x$ for all $x\in X$.

First somewhat vague question: is there a standard way of proving that a coalgebra $C$ is group-like? I have a linearly independent subset but can't prove yet that it's a basis.

Specifically I'm interested in the following. For $CD$ coalgebras there is a ""measuring coalgebra"" $(CD)$ see Sweedler Hopf algebras chapter VII. If $XY$ are sets and $kXkY$ are their coalgebras then ""obviously"" one should have $(kXkY)=k Map(XY)$. However it doesn't seem to follow easily from the definitions.

Recall that $(CD)$ is defined as follows. Consider the cofree coalgebra on $U$ on $Hom_k(CD)$; it admits an evaluation map $U\otimes C\to D$ simply written $u(c)$. Define then $(CD)$ as the maximal subcoalgebra of $U$ such that $\epsilon(u(c))=\epsilon(u)\epsilon(c)$ and $\Delta(u(c))=\Delta(u)(\Delta(c))$.

Letting $TCTD$ denote the tensor algebras ovec $CD$ respectively $U$ naturally sits inside $Hom_{graded}(TCTD)$. Then if $f:X\to Y$ is a map there corresponds the graded homomorphism $f(x_1\otimes...\otimes x_n)=f(x_1)\otimes...\otimes f(x_n)$ from $TC$ to $TD$ which is group-like. What is to be shown is that every homomorphism in $(CD)$ is a linear combination of such $f$'s.

Specifically there is certainly the intuition that the faster a power series' coefficients decrease the larger the radius of convergence will be - say comparing the geometric series with the exponential power series. When contrasted with lacunary series this seems to fail: the coefficients seem to be increasingly ""smaller"" at least in an average sense but the function becomes terribly ill-behaved. (One could try and argue that in the CesÃ ro sense the coefficients do tend to zero: if $\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{2^n}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^k$ then $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\approx\frac{\lfloor\log_2(n)\rfloor}{n}\rightarrow0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.

90252,"I have a question about the possibility to apply/restate the Kleene fixed point theorem on recursive subsets of computable functions. I don't know if this is trivial and/or if related questions have been already solved. Any suggestion is more than welcome.

Kleene fixed point theorem states that for every total computable function $T_i \simeq \varphi:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ there exists some $v\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
$\forall x T_{\varphi(v)}(x)\simeq T_v(x)$. That is the $v$-th ($T_v$) Turing Machine (TM) computes the same function as the $\varphi(v)$-th TM and $v$ is thus a ""fixed point"" for the transformation $\varphi$. 

Consider now a total computable function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. The recursive  (infinite) set $E=f(\mathbb{N})$ represents the subset of TMs/computable functions $T_{f(1)} T_{f(2)} ..$ we want to consider. Since $E$ is a recursive set we can use the notation $T^E_i$ to denote $T_{f(i)}$ i.e. $T^E_i$ is the i-th TM/function in $E$. Let $T^E_{i}\simeq\phi$ be a total computable function (if any). Now it is possible to restate the Kleene fixed point theorem on the set $E$? That is is it true that there exists some $v\in \mathbb{N}$ such that: $\forall x: T^E_{\phi(v)}(x)\simeq T^E_{v}(x)$? Note that we cannot apply here directly the Kleene's theorem since the property above translates into $\exists v \forall x: T_{f(\phi(v))}(x)\simeq T_{f(v)}(x)$ and the original (standard?) proof seems hard (if not impossible) to recode in this new setting (unless $f$ is assumed to be surjective in which case the problem becomes trivial). 

I don't expect this property to be true for all the possible recursive functions $f$ (it's just my non-expert opinion) so my question is: is it possible to characterize the class of mappings $f$ for which the above property is true? For example is this property true if we assume that the range of $f$ is a set of total functions?

One way is to sum each variable over $\pm 1$ which makes the terms we don't want cancel out and the others get multiplied by $2^{n^2}$. This gives (1) interpreting $G$ as the bipartite graph whose edges are the variables with value $-1$.  Alternatively note that each term has total degree $2n$ and the only possible such term with even degrees is $\prod_{i=1}^n x_{i\sigma(i)}^2$ for some permutation $\sigma$.  This shows $C=n!~$.

$\mathcal{I}\otimes k(0)$ $\simeq$ [$(x_{2}x_{0} x_{2}x_{1} x_{2}^2 x_{2}x_{3} x_{2}x_{4})$ + ideals of quartic rational cuves in $\mathbb{P^3}$]

(By the flat base change theorem they do computes functions $h^0$ and $h^1$ above)

Thank you Sandor-kovacs. I'm really appriciate about your kind explaination. But still there are two things make me confuse.

In my opinion the relations $x_{2}x_{0} = x_{2}x_{1}=x_{2}^2= x_{2}x_{3}=x_{2}x_{4}=0$ are already in the construction of the structure sheaf. After sheafifying those relation $x_{2}$ itself vanishes at any affine chart because $\frac {x_{2}}{x_{i}}=\frac{x_{2}x_{i}}{x_{i}^2}=0$.


I'ii appreciate to any feedbacks.

(edited)

I realize that my first question is foolish (I think that the geometric genus is 1) as Sander-Kovacs pointed out. But there are some problems remain.

At first I think Sander-Kovacs' answer is right. But if local sections $x_{2}$ were ""renegades"" and form a single global section then it does not contribute to higher cohomology modules. This was a real reason of my confusing.

Second question still remains. Precisely

$x_2 = \frac {x_2 x_0}{x_0}\in (x_2x_0 x_2x_1 x_2^2 x_2x_3 x_2x_4)_{(x_0)}\subset \mathscr {I} (U_{0})$ 

(I assumed $x_0$ has degree 0 as Sander-kovacs implicitly do. But my argument is same even if it has degree 1) 

There are some related problems. I'm continuously recalling that when one defines closed subscheme of $Proj S$ using its homogeneous ideal $I$ cutting off some lower degree part changes nothing because saturation of ideal(not the ideal it self) determines scheme structure. (see Hartshorne's book ch ii ex 3.12) Now note that 

$(x_0x_2x_1x_2x_2^2x_3x_2x_4x_2)$ = $\bigoplus_{d \geq 2} (x_2)_d$

If I were wrong then there are very serious gaps and errors of my whole undegraduate AG study.

90261,"Suppose we have two independent random variables $X$ (with distribution $p_X$) and $Y$ (with distribution $p_Y$) which take values in the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Let $Z = X +Y$ where the addition is done modulo $n$. Distribution of $Z$ is given by 
$$p_Z = p_X \circledast p_Y$$ where $\circledast$ stands for cyclic convolution. Suppose we were interested in minimising $H(Z)$ while keeping $H(X)$ and $H(Y)$ fixed. I also impose an additional constraint that $p_X(0) > 0$ and $p_Y(0) > 0$. The conjecture is as follows-  


  The $p_X$ and $p_Y$ which minimise $H(Z)$ have to be supported on the smallest possible subgroup $G$ of $Z_n$ that satisfies $$\log_2(|G|) \geq \max(H(X)H(Y))$$


Some Remarks:    


The constraint that $p_X(0) > 0$ and $p_Y(0) > 0$ is essentially to rule out $X$ and $Y$ being supported on some coset of $G$. One can even assume $p_X(0)$ and $p_Y(0)$ are the maximum probabilities in the distributions $p_X$ and $p_Y$ since we can always ""rotate"" the distributions and still keep $H(Z)$ the same.  
The intuition behind this is that we have the trivial lower bound
$$H(Z) \geq \max(H(X)H(Y)$$
and when $H(Y) \leq H(X) = \log_2 |G|$ this lower bound is actually attained. Also intuitively the more concentrated a distribution the lesser its entropy. So forcing $X$ and $Y$ to be supported in $G$ also ensures $Z$ is supported only on $G$ which is ""small"".
I'm not sure but I  think one can also pose this as a norm-extremisation problem instead of entropy by using the fact $$H(p_X) = \lim_{p \to 1}\frac{1}{1-p}\log_2 \sum p_X(i)^p$$
I unfortunately have very little empirical evidence. An exhaustive search of all possible ""entropy fixing"" distributions of $X$ and $Y$ goes out of hand very fast. My codes run only till $n=5$ in reasonable time and $4$ being the only composite number till then I've verified it only for $4$. Since things are much more cleaner for $2^n$ than for an arbitrary composite number maybe its true only for $\mathbb{Z}_{2^n}$.

What are conditions on $g_1g_2$ that enforce $L=0$ ? 



Original formulation: 

I have next situation:

Let $C_b(\mathbb R)=$ { $ f:\mathbb R\rightarrow \mathbb R $ } is the subset of $C(\mathbb R)$ consisting of all bounded continuous functions with a norm $\|\cdot\|$ defined as $\|f\|_\infty=\sup\|f(x)\|$.

Let $C_0(\mathbb R)=$ { $ f:\mathbb R\rightarrow \mathbb R $ } is the subset of $C(\mathbb R)$ consisting of functions such that for every $Îµ > 0$ there is a compact set $Kâ\mathbb R$ such that $|f(x)| &lt; Îµ$ for all $x \in \mathbb R\setminus K $. This is usually called the space of functions vanishing at infinity.

There are two homeomorphisms of the line $g_1 g_2$ and a continuous linear positive functional $l$ on $C_b(\mathbb R)$ which is invariant with respect to $g_1 g_2$. Also this functional is permanent: $l([C_0(\mathbb R)])=0$ so $l$ is ""concentrate at infinity"".

Then we make a Stone-Äech compactification of the $\mathbb R $ designated as $\beta \mathbb R $.

After Stone-Äech compactification of the line the homeomorphism still will be a homeomorphism and I can show that it will transfer $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R$ and the remainder $\mathbb R^* $ to $\mathbb R^* $ ($\mathbb R^* = \beta\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb R $). By the Riesz representation theorem for our linear functional (already on $\beta\mathbb R$ and still invariant) there is a unique regular countably additive Borel measure $\mu$ on $\beta\mathbb R$. I can show that this measure will be trivial zero at $\mathbb R$. I need to understand under which conditions on the homeomorphisms this measure will be trivial zero at $\mathbb R^* $. I will be very grateful for links on this problem.

elements (see 1. below). It is easy to show that this always holds for Banach lattices but gets tricky when trying to prove this more generally.

To be a bit more detailed let $X$ be a Banach space with a cone (or wedge) of 'positive' elements denoted by $X_{+}$; $X$ is then called an ordered Banach space and $x\leq y$ means $y-x\in X_{+}$. I will call $X_{+}$ generating if $X=X_{+}-X_{-}$; proper if $X_{+}\cap(-X_{+})={0}$; and normal if $0\leq x\leq y$ implies $\|x\|\leq\|y\|$. A bounded linear operator $T:X\to X$ is called positive if $x\geq 0$ implies $Tx\geq 0$. An ordered Banach space with the property that every positive operator satisfies $$\|T\|=\sup\{\|Tx\|:x\in X_{+}\|x\|=1\}$$ I will say has the positive operator property i.e. the norms of positive operators are completely determined by their behavior on the cone.

My question is:


  Let $X$ be an ordered Banach space
  with a closed proper generating
  normal cone. Is there a characterization of the positive operator property in terms of the cone-norm interaction?


Thus far I have found a few sufficient conditions:


For all $x\in X$ there exist $X\ni x_{1}x_{2}\geq0$ such that $x=x_{1}-x_{2}$ and $\|x_{j}\|\leq\|x\|$ for $j=12$.
For all $x\in X$ and $X\ni ab\geq0$ $-a\leq x\leq b$ implies $\|x\|\leq\max \{ \|a\|\|b\| \}$.


together imply the positive operator property.

Another sufficient condition is having the property that for any $x\in X$ it holds that $\|x\| = \inf \{\|z_+ + z_-\|:z_\pm \geq 0;x=z_+ -z_-\}$. Being a Banach lattice is sufficient to have this property (by invoking the property $\|x\|=\||x|\|$) but seems to be a bit more general since $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean norm and the `ice-cream cone' $\{(x_1x_2x_3):x_1\geq (x_2^2+x_3^2)^{1/2} \}$ (which is not a lattice) also has this property (so being a lattice is not necessary for the positive operator property). 

I've been unable to prove that any of these conditions are necessary. The last one had been my best bet so far but I'm beginning to doubt the existence of a nice list of conditions on the norm and cone that together are necessary and sufficient.

Any suggestions counterexamples or pointers to the literature that anyone
may have will be greatly appreciated.

Briefly speaking a singular manifold in a space $X$ is a pair $(M f)$ where $M$ is a closed smooth manifold and $f : M \to X$ is a map. Two singular manifolds of the same dimension $(M f)$ and $(N g)$ in $X$ are bordant if there is a pair $(W H)$ where $W$ is a bordism from $M$ to $N$ and $H : W \to X$ is a map restricting to $f$ and $g$ on $M$ and $N$. We define the bordism group $MO_n X$ to be the set of bordism classes of all $n$-dimensional singular manifolds in $X$ (this is indeed an abelian group under the addition induced by the coproduct of manifolds). It turns out that this gives rise to a homology theory i.e. the functors $MO_*$ satisfy the Eilenberg--Steenrod axioms. Strictly speaking one needs to define the relative bordism groups which are defined using bordism classes of singular compact manifolds with boundary i.e. maps $(M \partial M) \to (X A)$ and there are some issues with manifolds with corners to be resolved. The complete construction is explained very nicely in Differentiable Periodic Maps by Conner and Floyd. (Beware that there are a book and a paper by the same authors and with the same title I mean the book: Differentiable Periodic Maps LNM 738 1979.) There are also (even more interesting) variants of the bordism theory like $MU$ and $M \mathrm{Spin}$ which arise by considering additional structure on singular manifolds.

A homology theory $h_*$ satisfies the weak equivalence axiom if for every weak equivalence of pairs of spaces $f : (X A) \to (Y B)$ (i.e. a map such that both $f : X \to Y$ and $f | A : A \to B$ are weak equivalences) the induced map $h_*(X A) \to h_*(Y B)$ is an isomorphism. My question is exactly as in the title.


  Does the bordism homology theory satisfy the weak equivalence axiom?


An example of a homology theory that satisfies the weak equivalence axiom is singular homology. The way to prove this is as follows. Fix a pair of spaces $(X A)$ and a natural number $n$. Consider the Eilenberg subcomplex $\mathrm{Sing}^{(n A)} X$ of the singular complex $\mathrm{Sing} X$ which consist in degree $k$ of maps of pairs $(\Delta^k (\Delta^k)^{(n)}) \to (X A)$ where $(\Delta^k)^{(n)}$ is the $n$-skeleton of $\Delta^k$. One can prove that if $(X A)$ is $n$-connected then the induced inclusion of singular chain complexes $S_\bullet^{(n A)} X \to S_\bullet X$ is a chain homotopy equivalence and thus the relative groups $H_*(X A)$ are zero up to degree $n$.

This gave me an idea that maybe in case of bordism the weak equivalence axiom could be verified by choosing a triangulation on a manifold $M$ and considering maps $(M M^{(n)}) \to (X A)$ where $M^{(n)}$ is the $n$-skeleton of $M$ with respect to this triangulation. I was unable to find a proof along these lines. However if this approach has any merit at all then it means that the question has something to do with existence of triangulations of manifolds and thus the following may be a subtler variant of the question.


  Does the topological bordism homology theory (i.e. the one constructed using compact topological manifolds which do not necessarily admit triangulations) satisfy the weak equivalence axiom?


Some people may feel that the issue is somewhat immaterial since even if a homology theory doesn't satisfy the weak equivalence axiom then we simply prolong it from CW-complexes to all spaces by means of CW-replacement. However I feel that if some geometrically defined (co)homology theory satisfies the weak equivalence axiom for some class of spaces larger than CW-complexes then it is good to know how large exactly this class is. For example for singular homology this class consists of all spaces which makes the theory unexpectedly well-behaved. An example where it fails very badly is topological K-theory. There the geometric definition is wrong even for non-finite CW-complexes and one needs to use the representing spectrum to prolong the theory to all spaces.

I think they must be well known (perhaps Schur or Hermite polynomials or some variant thereof) but I haven't succeeded in finding them in the literature in a form that's recognizable to me.  If anyone can point me to an appropriate reference I would be grateful.  I suspect the answer to this must be very familiar to many people but I'm not one of those people.

The polynomials are indexed by Young diagrams (partitions) of all sizes (i.e. [] [1] [2] [11] [3] [21] [111] [4] ...).  

The measure respect to which they are orthogonal is
$$
    \prod_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi k}}e^{-\frac{x_k^2}{2k}}dx_k
$$
In other words a product of gaussian measures with the width proportional to $\sqrt{k}$.  (From some points of view it is more natural to replace $x_k$ with $x_k-1$ when $k$ is even; i.e. shift the gaussian to be centered at 1 instead of 0 when $k$ is even.)

The multiplication rule for the polynomials is more complicated than Littlewood-Richardson.  Multiplying polynomials corresponding to Young diagrams of sizes $a$ and $b$ results in Young diagrams of sizes ranging from $|a-b|$ to $a+b$.  (The highest order part of the multiplication rule is Littlewood-Richardson.)  For example $[1] * [21] = [2] + [11] + [31] + [22] + [211]$.

Grothendieck defers this definition to section 2 however and instead spends extensive time treating the definition of formally smooth given by:

Let $u: A\to B$ be a local homomorphism of local rings and suppose the residue field of $B$ is finite over the residue field of $A$.  Then $u$ is formally smooth (or Grothendieck states $B$ is formally smooth over $A$) if there exists a locally finite $\hat{A}$-algebra $A'$ which is free over $\hat{A}$ such that the (and I hope I translated the French correctly here) localizations of the semi-local ring $\hat{B}\otimes_{\hat{A}}A'$ are $A'$-isomorphic to the formal series over $A'$.

But one could equally well be guided by the goal of minimizing the logical depth of the axioms i.e. minimizing the use of quantifiers.

Consider group theory for instance.  I have seen formalizations of group theory that say ""There exists an element $h \in G$ such that for all $g \in G$ $gh=hg=g$"" and then go on to prove that $h$ is unique and to name it $e$.  But I have also seen formalizations that say ""A group is a set $G$ equipped with an element $e$ such that..."" which eliminates the need for a quantifier in an axiom.  Likewise if one includes the operation $g \mapsto g^{-1}$ as a primitive one can avoid the axiom ""For all $g$ there exists $h$ such that $gh=hg=e$"" (or worse ""For all $g$ there exists $h$ such that for all $h'$ $ ghh'=hgh'=h'gh=h'hg""$ which I haven't seen but which I can imagine a certain sorts of purist preferring!).

I know that in constructive mathematics the status of existential quantifiers is suspect to begin with so I imagine that there's already quite a bit of writing in foundations and philosophy of mathematics (and maybe computable mathematics as well) that addresses this issue.

Author starts with any partition $V(G)$ into two sets $XY$. Using the edges having one endpoint in each set yields a bipartite subgraph $H$ with bipartition $XY$. He said that if $H$ contains fewer than half the edges of $G$ incident to a vertex $v$ then $v$ has more edges to vertices in its own class than in the other class. Moving $v$ to the other class gains more edges of $G$ than it loses.

If $w_1 = w_2 = \cdots = w_{n-1} = 1$ and $\lambda$ is a positive integer then the above sum can be expressed as $$\displaystyle \sum_{x_1 + \cdots + x_n = \lambda} 1 - \sum_{x_2 + \cdots + x_n = \lambda - d} 1$$
which can be expressed in closed form:
$$\displaystyle \binom{\lambda + n - 1}{n-1} - \binom{\lambda - d + n - 1}{n-1}$$

A third sum I want to estimate is when the weight of the summands need not be the same as the original weight. In particular for integral weights $w_1 \cdots w_{n-1}$ and $v_1 \cdots v_{n-1}$ positive real numbers not identical to $w_1 \cdots w_{n-1}$ and $\lambda$ a positive integer:

 \end{matrix}$$
My question is what is the second chern class $c_2(\tilde Y):=c_2(\mathcal{T}_{\tilde{Y}})$ of the tangent sheaf of $\tilde{Y}$?

Remark: I am ultimately interested in the degree of $c_2(\tilde Y)c_1^{n-2}(\tilde Y)$. If I could understand the total chern class $c(\tilde Y)$ that would be even better.

My thoughts so far: The chern classes of $Y$ (and $X$) have well-known representation and there is a formula for computing the chern classes of blown-up varieties in Fulton's book Intersection Theory namely Theorem 15.4. For brevity I will quote his Example 15.4.3 which gives a formula for $c_2$:

$$c_2(\tilde Y) = f^\ast(c_2(Y)) - j_\ast\left( (d-1) g^\ast(c_1(X)) + \tfrac{d(d-3)}{2} \zeta + (d-2) g^\ast(c_1(\mathcal{N})) \right)$$

Here $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}_{X/Y}$ is the normal bundle of $X$ in $Y$ and $\zeta$ denotes $c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{X}}(1))$.

From Fulton's Example 3.2.12 we know that $c_1(X)=(m+1-d)\cdot\xi$ and $c_1(\mathcal{N})=d\cdot\xi$ with $\xi = c_1(\mathcal{O}_X(1))$. Now I am kinda stuck. I am not sure what the push-forwards and pullbacks really do - in particular what is $g^\ast(\xi)$ in terms of $\zeta$? What is $f^\ast$ applied to the class of a hyperplane? What does $j_\ast$ do? More importantly are these the right questions to ask? 

Ultimately I thought (hoped) it would be possible to express $c_2(\tilde Y)$ or even $c(\tilde Y)$ as a sum of intersections of ""obvious"" cycles in $\tilde Y$ possibly involving only the class of the (strict) transform of a hyperplane and the exceptional divisor.

Two observations:


No infinite subcollection of the partition can be locally finite since the union of a locally finite collection of closed sets is closed.

For real limits uniform convergence is sufficient. Is there a similar concept for limits of sets? Is something weaker sufficient? Or is this always true?

$$\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty}\ A_n = \bigcup_{N &lt; \infty} \left(\bigcap_{n \ge N} A_n \right)$$

90417,"[EDIT: This question as written contains a glaring error. It's sort of ""not a real question""? But I am resisting the temptation to delete it because I am going to make it into a real question.]

I tend to pay a lot of attention to when basepoints matter and when they don't. Currently something is bothering me:

Consider the ""homotopy category"" of unbased $1$-connected (i.e. simply-connected) spaces: that is start with spaces that have one path component and trivial fundamental group with unbased maps as the morphisms and invert the weak homotopy equivalences. Or if you prefer start with $CW$ spaces of that kind and pass to homotopy classes. I suppose that this is NOT actually (equivalent to) the homotopy category of any model category which is why I have used quotation marks above. 

[EDIT: As Fernando Muro points out in his answer the previous sentence is obviously wrong. The model structure described in the following paragraph with its artificial use of a basepoint does the job!]

If I do the same thing with basepoints there's no problem. For example I can take the usual category of based spaces but declare the weak equivalences to be the maps inducing isomorphisms of $\pi_j$ for all $j\ge 2$ at the basepoint. Then every object is equivalent to a $1$-connected space (in fact if you use the usual fibrations then all cofibrant objects are $1$-connected) and the homotopy category is as intended. The same kind of thing works for $k$-connected based spaces for other values of $k$. 

When $k=0$ it is easy to see that the ""homotopy category"" of $k$-connected (i.e. path-connected) unbased spaces is not a homotopy category of a model category. In fact it lacks coproducts. (Exercise: there is no universal example up to homotopy of a path-connected space equipped with two maps from the circle.) This is enough because the coproduct (colimit of discrete diagram) of cofibrant objects in a model category is always a homotopy colimit.

When $k=-1$ (so that $k$-connected spaces means nonempty spaces) it is even easier to see: The homotopy category of nonempty spaces has no initial object.

[EDIT: I will leave this as it stands even though the answer is come to think of it obviously ""no"".]

QUESTION 1: Is it true that the homotopy category of (unbased) $1$-connected spaces cannot be the homotopy category of a model category?

This is not so obvious. You can't just say something like ""a homotopy category must have all limits and colimits"" because homotopy limits and colimits are not in fact limits and colimits in a homotopy category in general -- the homotopy category of spaces does not have pullbacks.

(I presume that most of what I said above more or less applies to other popular ways of axiomatizing homotopy theory such as $\infty$-categories.) 

Apart from this technical question I have a vague philosophical question:

QUESTION 2: If the answer to Question 1 is ""yes"" what is the right response?

I am thinking of rational homotopy theory for example. I recall that when Quillen worked out an indirect equivalence between on the one hand $1$-connected spaces and rational equivalences and on the other hand $0$-connected commutative differential graded coalgebras over $\mathbb Q$ he used based spaces and coaugmented coalgebras. It's clear why. But Sullivan's equivalence between rational homotopy theory of simply connected spaces and commutative dgas works without basepoints right? He doesn't do it in a model category framework and (this is really beside the point) he needs finite type conditions. It seems unnatural to insist on based spaces just for the sake of (model category or other) axioms. On the other hand they are such nice axioms ...

$$\epsilon_{ij} = 0 \Leftrightarrow L_{ij} = 1.$$ 
For $k > 0$ let
$$T(k) = L + E(k)$$
be an analytic perturbation of $L$ where
$$ E(k){ij} = \exp(-kE{ij}). $$
Then $T(k)$ is a positive operator thus it has a unique principal (Perron) eigenvalue and eigenvector denoted $\rho(k)$ and $v(k)$ respectively. It is known that as $k \to \infty$ $\rho(k)^{1/k}$ converges to 1 and $v(k)^{1/k}$ (elementwise) converges to the all 1's vector. (This is because we forced the row sum of $L$ to be 1. In general these guys converge to the tropical max-times eigenvalue and eigenvector of $L$ respectively but this is not important to the question). 

My question is: for large $k$ what we can say about the ""rate of convergence"" of  the quantities $\rho(k)^{1/k}$ and $v(k)^{1/k}$? By this I mean I want to know have an expansion of the type
$$\rho(k)^{1/k} = 1 + \mbox{ (higher order terms in $k$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$)} $$
and I'd like to know the expansion to as much precision as possible. 

Some thoughts: the eigenvalues of $L$ are the $r$ roots of unity each with multiplicity 1 and $0$ with multiplicity $n - r$. Thus easy off-the-shelf bounds on the operator norm of $E(k)$ (and Grioschinn-disks type of arguments) give a rate that is dependent on $r$. 
However $\rho(k)^{1/k}$ is a real number bigger than 1 thus this sequence is converging towards the real eigenvalue $1$ from above on the real axis in $\mathbb{C}$. Thus the ""correct"" convergence rate should not depend on $r$ (and this is true in simulations). The reason is these theorems do not take into account the fact that the perturbed operator is positive and that we really have an analytic perturbation. 

Some pointers on how to handle this problem would be much appreciated. I feel that this type of perturbation must have been studied in the literature (especially physics?) I'm also not familiar with analytic perturbation of operators myself - I've read a little of Baumgartel's book but didn't see immediately relevant results. Reference pointers would also be great.

The ring of polynomials (with coefficients in ${\mathbb R}$) in these measures will be denoted $\mathcal{O}(X)=\text{Sym}(V_X)$ and called the ring of quasi-measures (for lack of a better term). We may denote an element of $\mathcal{O}(X)$ by $\mu$ even if it is a quasi-measure and not a genuine measure. 

If $U\subseteq X$ is a measurable subset then evaluation at $U$ gives a ring homomorphism $$e^~_U\colon\mathcal{O}(X)\to{\mathbb R}\hspace{.3in}e_U^~(\mu):=\mu(U).$$ (This homomorphism is formally clear because $\mathcal{O}(X)$ is the free commutative ring on the measures; the idea is that a polynomial in measures can be evaluated by adding and multiplying values in the obvious way.)

90464,"I took the following game from the Peter Winkler collection (chapter ""Games""):

Two numbers are chosen independently at random from the uniform distribution on [01]. Player A then looks at the numbers. She must decide which one of them to show to player B who upon seeing it guesses whether it's the larger or smaller of the two. If he guesses right B wins otherwise A wins. Payoff to a player is his/her winning probability.

One easily identifies the following mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:

""Player A shows the larger number with prob 1/2 and player B guesses 'larger' with prob 1/2""

The book also suggests a smart pure strategy for A which is in effect identical to her mixed strategy above (in the sense that locks her winning prob at 1/2 regardless of B's strategy): 

""Player A shows the number which is closer to 1/2"" 

A little thought shows that B also has a pure strategy in like manner:

""Player B guesses larger iff the number he sees exceeds 1/2""

Together these two strategies form a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.



To be clear let me define a pure strategy for B as a function ${f}_{B}:[01]\longmapsto \{larger smaller\}$ i.e. he assigns ""larger"" or ""smaller"" to every real in [01].

Similarly A's pure strategy is a function $f_A(\{xy\})=x\ or\ y$ i.e. she assigns x or y to every set $\{xy\}$ where $xy\in [01]$.

My question is: Is the above pure strategy Nash equilibrium unique? Given the above definition there are infinite pure strategies for each player. Could other less obvious or highly artificial equilibria be constructed? How can we prove or disprove the uniqueness of equilibrium from those infinite strategies?

By  $ \bar{P} $   we denote a topological pair of pants ( that is a 2-sphere with three open disks removed ) with boundary and by $P$ we would mean the same without any boundary. Let $\mathcal {Mod(\bar{P})}$ denote the space of all complete hyperbolic metric on  $ \bar{P} $ which make the boundary components of $P$   geodesics ; call these geodesics $\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_3 $ . Since these metrics are completely determined by the hyperbolic lengths $ l_1 l_2 l_3 $ of the three boundary components we can give  $ \mathcal { Mod(\bar{P} ) } $ the co-ordinates $ l_1 l_2 l_3 $  and so think of $ \mathcal { Mod(\bar{P} ) } $ as $\mathbb{R_+}^3$. Consider the following map $ F : \mathcal {Mod(\bar{P})} \cong  \mathbb{R_+}^3   \to  \mathbb{R_+}^3    $ defined as follows : 

$m_i$  is the module of the maximal ring domain in  $ \bar{P} $ whose core curve is homotopic to $ \gamma_i $ i.e. for all ring domain $R_i$'s whose core curve is homotopic to $ \gamma_i $ we have $ m_i = sup mod (R_i) $ and this supremum is achieved by a ring domain which is the the pair of pants $\bar{P}$ minus the unique geodesic joining $ \gamma_{i+1 modulo 3} \gamma_ {i+2 modulo 3} . $. Now define the map : $ F : \mathcal {Mod(\bar{P})}   \to  \mathbb{R_+}^3   $ by $ F(l_1l_2l_3) = (m_1m_2m_3) $. I was wondering whether this map is a homeomoprhism of $ \mathbb{R_+}^3 $.

90509,"Setup: Suppose we are given a smooth function $\phi$ that has a nondegenerate minimum at $x=0$. Then we can choose a coordinate system $x$ such that the gradient is given by
$$X = \mathrm{grad} \phi = \sum_i a_i x^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + O(|x|^2) $$
where the $a_i>0$ are the eigenvalues of the Hessian of $\phi$ at $x=0$.

Now we look for smooth functions $a$ and numbers $\lambda$ such that
$$ X^i \frac{\partial a}{\partial x^i}= \lambda a.$$

If we can somehow (smoothly) linearize $X$ then it is straight forward that the only solutions are $\lambda = k^1 a_1 + \dots + k^n a_n$ together with $a = x^k$ and we also have the expected multiplicities of eigenvalues meaning to each multiindex $k$ corresponds exactly one eigenvalue.

Question: The question is now if a linearization is possible. There is a theorem by Sternberg and PoincarÃ© that gives a positive answer under the additional assumption that the condition
$$ a_i \neq m^1 a_1 + \dots + m^{i-1} a_{i-1} + m^{i+1} a_{i+1} +\dots + m^n a_n$$
with all $m^i\geq 0$ is satisfied but does not use that $X$ is a gradient field. So I am hoping that one can maybe drop the condition in this case?

Motivation: The question arose when following the WKB method outlined in the literature. Helffer (Semi-Classical Analysis for the SchrÃ¶dinger Operator and Applications) does cite the Sternberg theorem but doesn't even mention the condition above. Dimassi and SjÃ¶strand (Spectral Asymptotics in the Semiclassical Limit) use other methods than linearization but require instead that all numbers of the form
$$ m^1 a_i + \dots + m^n a_n$$
are different which is even a stronger condition. The whole situation seems a bit curious here.

P.S.: Even if a Linearization is not possible I would like to know if it is true that the eigenvalues are exactly $k^1 a_1 + \dots k^n a_n$ counted with multiplicity in the general setup or if one actually needs some of these diophantine-type conditions above. Easy linear examples show that the statement can still be true if Sternberg's condition is violated.

$$|b(tx)|+|\sigma(tx)| \leq C(1+|x|)$$
and
$$|b(tx)-b(ty)|+|\sigma(tx)-\sigma(ty)| \leq C|x-y|$$
then there is a unique strong solution to the SDE
$$dX_t=b(tX_t)dt+\sigma(tX_t)dB_t.$$

I have seen papers/books talk about solving this SDE for $t&lt;\tau_D$ where $\tau_D$ is the first time $X_t$ leaves an open set $D$.  In this case we may only have $b$ and $\sigma$ defined on $[0T] \times D$.  I am wondering what precisely is meant by this.

One interpretation is to extend $b$ and $\sigma$ to functions defined on $[0T] \times \mathbb{R}^n$ by defining $b(tx)=\sigma(tx)=0$ for $x \notin D$ but if we do this we kill the Lipschitz property and no longer are guaranteed uniqueness (intuitively it seems like what happens outside of $D$ should not effect what happens to the process before it leaves $D$ but . . .).  Another way is to use something like Kirszbraun's Theorem to extend $b$ and $\sigma$ to Lipschitz functions functions on $[0T] \times \mathbb{R}^n$ use the existence theorem to find a solution to the SDE and then stop the solution at $\tau_D$.  Since there might be multiple ways to extend $b$ and $\sigma$ it's not immediately clear that this solution is unique.  I think you can argue if it weren't (at least when $b$ $\sigma$ don't depend on $t$) you could piece together a solution up to time $\tau_D$ and a solution from $\tau_D$ to $T$ to contradict the uniqueness of the solution up until time $T$.  This all seems too complicated though.

I am wondering what the ""right"" way of thinking about this sort of thing is (a reference to a book would be great).

EDIT

A useful text that was suggested to me on math.stackexchange is this.  It appears the right way to think about things is indeed to take a global Lipschitz extension and then solve the resulting equation (and argue that up until $\tau_D$ the solution does not depend on the extension).

This is much stronger than just requiring $F$ and $G$ to induce inverse equivalences of homotopy categories: For an example let $\mathcal C$ be the category of chain complexes over a field with quasi-isomorphisms as weak equivalences and $\mathcal D$ the subcategory of complexes with zero boundary map. ($F$ is the homology functor and $G$ is the inclusion.) You can see that this is not giving an equivalence of homotopy categories because if it did then it would also give an equivalence of homotopy categories of $I$-diagrams for any $I$. Of course if $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal D$ are model categories then a Quillen equivalence gives an equivalence in the sense I mean (after restricting to categories of fibrant-cofibrant objects). But let's look at this simpler notion.

This is meant to be an improvement on my previous question http://mathoverflow.net/questions/90417/when-do-basepoints-matter-in-homotopy-theory. I was tempted to delete the latter but decided to let it stand for its possible educational value and as a hairshirt for myself. I seriously suggest that nobody should upvote this question without downvoting that one. 

Consider the category of simply-connected spaces (a.k.a. $1$-connected spaces i.e those having exactly one path component and trivial fundamental group) and continuous maps. We can universally invert the weak homotopy equivalences and get what might be called the homotopy category of $1$-connected spaces. This can be described as a full subcategory of the homotopy category associated to the Quillen model structure on $Top$. Alternatively it can be described as the category whose objects are $1$-connected $CW$ complexes and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of maps. Note that I am using unbased spaces and unbased maps here. 

QUESTION 1: Is there an equivalence of homotopy theories in the sense defined above between $1$-connected spaces and (the fibrant-cofibrant objects of) some model category.

Another good example of a functor inducing an equivalence of homotopy categories but NOT an equivalence of homotopy theories is the forgetful functor from based $1$-connected spaces to unbased $1$-connected spaces. The positive statement just means that every unbased map between based $1$-connected spaces is homotopic to a based map and that two such based maps are based homotopic if they are homotopic. The negative statement can be proved by using what I said above about categories of diagrams; for example you can get a contradiction by picking an action of a group on a $1$-connected space such that the homotopy fixed point set is empty.

The category of $1$-connected based spaces is equivalent in this sense to a model category. You can colocalize the category of based spaces. The main idea is this: In the category of based spaces every object has a universal $1$-connected object over it. 
As some kind of evidence for a ""no"" answer to the question above note that the statement in the last sentence is false for unbased $1$-connected spaces. More evidence: a ""yes"" answer would seem to lead to a reasonable theory of homotopy limits and colimits within unbased $1$-connected spaces. How could that go? In the based setting hocolim is usual hocolim and holim is universal covering space of basepoint component of usual holim.

All of the above statements questions and suggestions about $1$-connected spaces have analogues in which weak homotopy equivalence is replaced by rational equivalence. Sullivan's version
of rational homotopy theory shows that the theory of unbased $1$-connected spaces of finite type is equivalent to that of the opposite of $1$-connected commutative DGAs (differential graded algebras) of finite type. I presume that this can be used to see that the theory of (unbased) $1$-connected spaces is equivalent to that of $1$-connected commutative DGCs (differential graded coalgebras). Quillen's version gives an alternative route but with basepoints: a chain of Quillen equivalences between based $1$-connected spaces and $1$-connected based (i.e. coaugmented) commutative DGCs (differential graded coalgebras).

90540,"It is well known that the number of rows in the semistandard Young tableaux correspondent to a two-line array via RSK is equal to the length of the longest (strictly) decreasing subsequence in the array's second line in the case the array's columns are ordered lexicographically. Note that this statement by itself involves nothing more than the definition of Schensted's row insertion procedure (row bumping). Namely it can be rephrased in the following way: the number of rows in $(\ldots((\emptyset\leftarrow x_1)\leftarrow x_2)\leftarrow\ldots)\leftarrow x_n$ is equal to the length of the longest decreasing subsequence in $(x_1x_2\ldotsx_n)$ where $\leftarrow$ is row insertion and $\emptyset$ denotes the empty tableau.

However proofs of this fact I've come across are quite complicated in the sense that they tend to employ some more or less advanced theoretic basis. For an example see exercise 1 in Â§3.2 of W. Fulton's book ""Young tableaux: with applications to representation theory and geometry"" and the proposed solution to it. I'm looking for a short self-contained proof of the above statement considering row insertion.

Actually I'd be more than satisfied by such a proof for the number of rows  not exceeding the length of the longest decreasing subsequence.  Note that the in a way dual fact of the number of columns not exceeding the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence is nearly obvious.  It may not be obvious but can certainly be proven very simply see Schensted's original paper.

 Clarification.  By short I mean really short. Short enough to post as 1-2 screen long answer here without a single external reference. Once again the motivation here is that the standard proof of the ""dual"" statement definitely satisfies this criterion.

90544,"I have recently been studying with colleagues the representation theory of certain finite monoids that come up in probability theory and combinatorics see Ken Brown's beautiful survey here.

These monoid have a split basic algebra over any field which is directed quasi-hereditary  (standard modules are projective/costandards are simple). Thus they have acyclic quivers and can be written as the quotient of the path algebra of their quiver by an admissible ideal. 

We can compute $\mathrm{Ext}^n(SS')$ between simple modules $SS'$ and so can get the quiver by taking dimensions when $n=1$. We can also get the number of relations from $n=2$. 


  
     Question. Is there some homological way to get at a quiver presentation of a split basic algebra with an acyclic quiver? You can assume the field is algebraically closed if it helps. 
  


We do have explicit complete sets of primitive idempotents for these algebras but they are sufficiently complicated that we don't even know how to recover the description of the quiver using the primitive idempotents. 

The only cases where quiver presentations are known are for oriented matroids (in particular hyperplane arrangements) and of course the hereditary case. 

The situation is so embarrassing that we have global dimension 2 examples with a single relation and we can't find the relation.

90545,"I seek an example of an amenable group of finite cohomological dimension that is not virtually polycyclic and has finite abelianization.

Remarks.


Elementary amenable groups of finite cohomological dimension are virtually solvable.
There are lots of virtually abelian groups of finite cohomological dimension that have finite abelianization. The simplest one is the fundamental group of a certain flat 3-manifold the Hantsche-Wendt manifold.
Virtually polycyclic groups are finitely presented so perhaps an example can be found among virtually solvable groups that are not finitely presentable which do exist.
Elementary amenable groups of cohomological dimension two are classified here see Theorem 3 and they have infinite abelianization (except for the trivial group). 
Another idea would be to search for an amenable group that is not elementary amenable.
There are very few known examples and I do not know if any of the examples have finite cohomological dimension and finite abelianization.  See here for a list of torsion-free examples (of course finite cohomological dimension implies torsion-free.

What's the probability that the next sample $x_{n+1}$ is at least $\varepsilon$ away from any of the previous samples $x_1x_2\dotsx_n$? $\varepsilon > 0$ is a fixed constant.

I tried to formulate this problem as:
Given $x_1x_2\dotsx_n$ i.i.d from $\mathcal{P}$ the probability of the new sample fall outside the $\varepsilon$ ball of any previous samples is (given you know $x_{n+1}=x$ the previous n samples are all far away from it):

90548,"Suppose we are handed an algebra $A$ over a field $k$.  What should we look at if we want to determine whether $A$ can or cannot be equipped with structure maps to make it a Hopf algebra?

I guess in order to narrow it down a bit I'll phrase it like this: what are some necessary conditions on an algebra for it to be a Hopf algebra?

Thoughts so far:

The first obvious condition is that $A$ must be augmented i.e. there must be a nontrivial character $\varepsilon : A \to k$.  Since this is generally not that hard to determine if we are given the algebra in some fairly concrete way let's suppose that $A$ is given to us with an augmentation map.

If $A$ is finite-dimensional then $A$ must be a Frobenius algebra.  But not every finite-dimensional Frobenius algebra is a Hopf algebra e.g. $\Lambda^\bullet(k^2)$ is not a Hopf algebra if the characteristic of $k$ is not 2.  And generally I am more interested in the infinite-dimensional case.

All I can come up with is this: the category of finite-dimensional $A$-modules must be a (left) rigid monoidal category.  But I don't know if that is a helpful observation: given a category with a forgetful functor to finite-dimensional vector spaces over some field how can one prove that it can't be given the structure of a braided rigid monoidal category?

And perhaps there are some homological invariants that one can look at?

To sum up the question is:

90558,"I've asked this question at stat-exchange and at the ""Semnet""-mailing list of professionals in statistics. The reference to some articles in Psychometrica (for instance ten Berge 1995 Jennrich 2001) were insofar helpful that I saw that reasons for nonsuccessful rotation were handled - but the explicite statement whether the iteration with plane-wise rotations using the Varimax- or Quartimax-criterion is always converging /can always be made converging was not made/referred to. (This is different for instance for the case of using the principal components-criterion for which I think I've come across an explicite proof ~20 years ago).      

The reason to ask this is an approach to the Hadamard-matrix-problem: the Hadamard-matrix is defined to consist of entries +1 and -1 only and being orthogonal.
Being orthogonal means to have the form of a rotation-matrix simply scaled by one scalar factor such that all entries have the desired value -1 or +1. That means the variance of the squared entries is zero. So if I begin with any initial rotation-matrix and rotate to minimal (instead of maximal) variance using the inverse of the ""varimax"" or of the ""quartimax""-criterion say ""varimin"" or ""quartimin"" I should arrive at a proper Hadamard-matrix scalar scaled by the reciprocal of the square of the number of rows/columns.    

Indeed this works for small sizes (up to n=20 so nxn=20x20) and ""sometimes"" for n=24 but then the Hadamard-form is found extremely seldom.
Ten Berge (1995) gave insight in the rotation procedure noting that sometimes convergence is not reached because of systematic missing of optimization of some planes in the iterative process but which might be overcome by some workaround. The global convergence question however was not explicitely mentioned as solved.      

Question: is a proof for the convergence to the global optimum by the iterative plane-wise rotation using the quartimax/varimax-rotation known? Or is it known that it does not always converge?) (If it is simple enough it might be done here or else a reference were good. I've it -surprisingly- not seen in the monographies on factor analysis of for instance S.Mulaik(74) or K.Ãberla(68) .  

(This ""varimin""-rotation-approach to the Hadamard-matrix problem has its further charme because it is also applicable to matrices which have other dimensions than n=4*m and is thus some more general formulation/notion for that problem: ""the lower bound for the variance of the squared entries of orthogonal matrices of size nxn where n=4m is zero"" )

I have recently borrowed Serge Lang's ""Challenges"" from the library. I had heard about it for several years but had not had the opportunity to see it. (I could only locate five copies in French university libraries and had to use interlibrary loan.) I first thought I would read only one or two chapters but ended up reading the whole book in a few days. 

Motivation

I do not want to get subjective or argumentative here suffice it to say that I hold Lang's attitude and views in very high esteem and this provides motivation for this question.

Background

For some background on Lang and his files one can read the first part of Lang's obituary in the AMS Notices at http://www.ams.org/notices/200605/fea-lang.pdf. 

The book ""Challenges"" was published in 1997. I guess Lang went on to gather documentation regarding several cases dealt with in the book after its publication. Consequently several related files must have contained much more documentation at the time of Lang's demise than at the time of ""Challenges"" publication. Besides ""Challenges"" does not deal with all the cases Lang has been involved with and interested in.

In addition the AMS obituary mentions that Lang ""has some unpublished books of a political nature"".


  Are the full (i.e. the whole documentation that Lang had gathered and arranged) files regarding the ""Challenges"" cases (i.e. those dealt in that book) published somewhere? If not are they available in some other form? What has happened to Lang's related personal papers?

Bilinear Forms"" by J. Milnor and D. Husemoller.

Theorem (9.5 pp 46) For any dimension n there exists a positive
definite inner product space $X$ of type $1$ and rank $n$ with
$\min_{x \in X \setminus {0}} x.x \geq n ($n \rightarrow \infty$)$.

In particular the theorem implies the existence of a self-dual

can be seen as a bound on the ""average"" number of solutions to a
quadratic equation. The equation of interest for me is x.x = k i.e.
the number of vectors of a particular length $k$ from an inner-product
space $X$.

The above mentioned book does not give a proof for the Siegel's
theorem. Additionally the proof of Theorem 9.5 uses some results over
p-adic integers and others on genus of bilinear form spaces to show
that the number of solutions of the equation x.x=k summed for k \in
{1 \dots n} is &lt;2 if averaged over all distinct linear product

What I am interested in is a more refined case. Suppose that $H D$ are positive integers and suppose that $(a_h b_h c_h d_h)$ $1 \leq h \leq H$ are tuples of integers. Consider the monomials $m_r(a b c d) = a^u b^v c^w d^x$ where $u + v + w + x = D$ and $uvwx$ are non-negative integers. Here we allow $(uvwx)$ to range over all possible choices. Let $R$ be the number of such monomials which by construction is $\displaystyle \binom{D+3}{3} = \frac{(D+3)(D+2)(D+1)}{6}$ and consider the $H \times R$ matrix where the $hr$-th entry is the monomial $m_r(a_h b_h c_h d_h)$. Finally we can assume that $R &lt; H$ to make the problem interesting.

Now suppose that the integers $a_h b_h c_h d_h$ $1 \leq h \leq H$ are chosen uniformly from the set {$-k \cdots -1 0 1 \cdots k$} say then what is the probability that the resulting matrix will have rank at most $R-1$?

I take the problem of cumulants to be this: given a sequence $(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)$ of real numbers is it the sequence of cumulants of some probability distribution?  In one sense this is trivially equivalent to the problem of moments: the $n$th moment is a polynomial in the first $n$ cumulants and vice-versa.  But cumulant sequences have a nice property that moment sequences don't have: the set of all such sequences is closed under addition.  So draw a ray out from the origin $(000\ldots)$.  If the ray bumps into a cumulant sequence $(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)$ then $2(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)3(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)\ldots$ are also cumulant sequences.

For infinitely divisible distributions for every real $t\ge 0$ the sequence $t(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)$ is a cumulant sequence.

Besides the nonnegative integers and the nonnegative reals there are other sets of nonnegative reals closed under addition.

For which sets $T$ of nonnegative reals that are closed under addition is it the case that for some cumulant sequence $(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)$ for every real $t\ge 0$
$$
t\in T \quad\text{iff}\quad t(\kappa_1\kappa_2\kappa_3\ldots)\text{ is a cumulant sequence ?}

I'm guessing only closed sets but there should be more than that to say about it I would think.  Even describing or classifying the (topologically) closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^+$ that are closed under addition might be something of a chore and I suspect many of them are not of this form.

That moderately complicated things might happen is at least hinted at by the case of $p\times p$ Wishart matrices for which the number of degrees of freedom can be anywhere in the set $\lbrace 0\dotsp-1\rbrace\cup (p-1\infty)$.

There Zoll surfaces appear as counterexamples of the analogous question on $S^2$ (and spoil all the fun) so maybe one should concentrate on the projective plane where the only Zoll Riemannian metric is the the canonical metric. 

Remark. Notice that there are tons of very nice reversible Finsler Zoll metrics on the projective plane. Indeed here is the Busemann recipe to cook up  smooth  reversible Finsler metrics on $RP^2$ such that all geodesics are projective lines :


Take a smooth strictly positive measure on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is invariant under the antipodal map.
If $x$ and $y$ are distinct non-antipodal points let $X$ and $Y$ denote the great circles obtained by intersecting the sphere with the subspaces orthogonal to $x$ and $y$.
The union of $X$ and $Y$ cuts the sphere into four connected components. 
Define the distance between $x$ and $y$ as the measure of the smallest of these components. 
VoilÃ  you have a metric on the sphere that being invariant under the antipodal map projects down to a metric on the projective plane. It is easy to see that projective lines are geodesics and not too hard to see that it is Finsler.

90604,"I try to understand and compare the following facts about maps into classifying spaces of topological categories. Consider first the following definition cited from Moerdijk's Classifying Spaces and Classifying Topoi.

A linear order over a topological space $X$ is a (set-valued) sheaf $L$ on $X$ (also known as etale topological space) together with a subsheaf $\mathcal{O} \subseteq L\ \times_X\ L$ such that for each point $x \in X$ the stalk $L_x$ is non-empty and linearly ordered by the relation 
$$
y \leq z \quad iff \quad (yz) \in \mathcal{O}_x
$$
This defines a simplicial topological space $N_{\bullet}$ with
$$
N_m(L) = \{(y_0 \dots y_n)Â |\ y_0 \leq \dots \leq y_n\ in\ L \}
$$
Now let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category internal to topological spaces. A morphism of linear orders is a map of sheaves which restricts to an order-preserving map on the stalks. 

An augmentation of $L$ is a map of simplicial spaces $N_{\bullet}(L) \to Nerve_{\bullet}(\mathcal{C})$. A morphism of augmented linear orders is a morphism of linear orders that respects the augmentations. The category of augmented linear orders will be denoted by $Lin(X\mathcal{C})$. Two elements of this category will be called concordant if there is an augmented linear order over $X \times [01]$ such that it restricts to the given ones over the endpoints. Denote by $Lin_c(X\mathcal{C})$ the concordance classes.

The last theorem in Moerdijk's book says:


  
    If $\mathcal{C}$ is a locally contractible topological category and $X$ is a CW-complex then there is a bijection
    $$ [X B\mathcal{C}] \cong Lin_c(X\mathcal{C}) .$$
  


There is another result about maps of this kind which is quite similar and can be found in a paper by Baas BÃ¶kstedt and Kro and says 


  
    Assume that $X$ is a CW-complex and $Z_{\bullet}$ is a good simplicial space then geometric realization induces a bijection $$Con_{Z_{\bullet}}(X) \cong [X |Z_{\bullet}|] $$
  


where the elements of $Con_{Z_{\bullet}}(X)$ are given by maps of simplicial spaces of the form $\mathcal{U}_{\bullet} \to Z_{\bullet}$ where $\mathcal{U}_{\bullet}$ denotes the ordered Cech-complex as a simplicial space build from an ordered open cover of $X$. Taking $Z_{\bullet}$ to be the nerve of $\mathcal{C}$ we get a bijection
$$
Lin_c(X \mathcal{C}) \cong Con_{Nerve(\mathcal{C})_{\bullet}}(X)
$$
for nice enough topological categories $\mathcal{C}$.

After this lengthy explanation here is my question:


  
    Since you can cook up a linear order from an ordered covering of $X$ there is a map $$Con_{Nerve(\mathcal{C})_{\bullet}}(X) \to Lin_c(X \mathcal{C})$$ which should fit into the setup described above.
    So somehow it seems to be the case that every linear order is concordant to one coming from an ordered covering. Is this true? Can this be proven directly? 
    
    EDIT: Can I prove directly that the above map is a bijection i.e. does every augmented  linear order come from one induced by an open covering?

Various globalizations of $X$ are given as spaces of sequences $(x(\mu))_{\mu\in\hat{K}}$ with certain conditions on  $\| x(\mu)\| _\mu$. These conditions also lead to a canonical topology on the globalizations.

However if the variance of $Y$ is also much higher than the variance of $X$ it might just be that $Y$ is a poor estimator and the different mean is not meaningful (if you'll excuse the pun).

So for a fixed $X$ I need a function of $Y$ that increases with $\left|\mu_Y-\mu_X\right|$ but that decreases with $\sigma_Y$ (and is zero if and only if $\sigma_Y = \sigma_X$ and $\mu_Y = \mu_X$).

90658,"I heard this really neat elementary proof of the ""Gauss-Bonnet Theorem"" :

Let $S$ be a surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Now take a triangulation of that surface and approximate the surface with a triangular mesh (""flatten"" the triangles).

Call $\delta(v)$ the angle defect at a vertex $v$ that is $2\pi$ minus the sum of the angles around the vertex $v$. Now the Euler characteristic is defined at $\chi(S) = V - E + F$. Also if we assume that the surface is without boundary then every face has $3$ bounding edges and every edge bounds $2$ faces which means $2E=3F$ so $F=2(E-F)$.

Let's compute the sum of all the angle defects at all the vertices of the mesh in two different ways. First sum the angle defect at each vertex that is $\sum_{v} \delta(v)$. Second for each triangle the sum of the angles is exactly $\pi$ since they are euclidean triangles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so we can sum of the angles of all the faces and get $F\pi$ and subtract that from what the total angle sum would be if the surface were flat to get $2 \pi V - F \pi$. Using the formula for the Euler characteristic we get

$\sum_{v} \delta(v) = 2 \pi V - \pi F$

$\sum_{v} \delta(v) = 2\pi (V - E + F) = 2\pi\chi(S)$

Now to make that into the ""real"" Gauss-Bonnet Theorem I heard the argument ""take an infinitesimal triangulation then the angle defect becomes the curvature"". Is there any way to make this rigorous with a reasonable amount of not too advanced tools? If so can I get a reference?

where $h_ih\in k[X_1\dotsX_{n+1}]$ and $g_i\in k[X_1\dotsX_n].$
One then applies the weak Nullstellensatz to see that indeed every element of $k[X_1\dotsX_{n+1}]$ can be written in the above form. Then mapping back to the smaller polynomial ring via $X_{n+1} \mapsto \frac{1}{f}$ yields the result by simply clearing denominators.

Theorem 7.8.9 : H^i(g M) = 0 for any nontrivial irreducible representation M of g if g is semisimple over char 0 field.

Proof:
Suppose that $G$ has an abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ with normal complement $N$. 
Then $P \simeq G/N$ is abelian so $G' \leq N$. But $p \nmid |N|$ so $p \nmid |G'|$.
Suppose conversely that $p \nmid |G'|$. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and let $\theta:G \rightarrow G/G'$ be the natural projection. Then $P \cap G'$ is trivial and so $\theta$ restricted to $P$ is an isomorphism. But $G/G'$ is abelian so $P$ is abelian. Since $G/G'$ is abelian there exists a subgroup $M$ such that $G/G' = \theta(P) \times M$. Let $\psi:G/G' \rightarrow \theta(P)$ be the natural projection. Then put $N:=\ker(\psi \circ \theta)$.

Question: is there a nice relationship between the row/column sums of $B$ and the  eigenvalues of $A$?  Specifically can we obtain lower bounds for the largest eigenvalue of $A$ with the one of the following forms (or similar in nature):

(1) $\displaystyle\max_{1\leq j\leq n}\sum_{k=1}^mb_{jk}$ + $\displaystyle\min_{1\leq k\leq m}\sum_{j=1}^n b_{jk}$ - 1 $\leq  \lambda_{\max}(A)$.

OR

(2) $\displaystyle\max_{1\leq j\leq n}\sum_{k=1}^m|b_{jk}|$ + $\displaystyle\min_{1\leq k\leq m}\sum_{j=1}^n |b_{jk}|$ - 1 $\leq  \lambda_{\max}(A)$.

Obviously $B$ would need to have some special condition in (1) to make sure these sums are real.  Perhaps this is too strong but it would be useful to have such a relationship.  Here is some possible motivation:

The Laplacian matrix of a simple graph $G$ can be written as $L(G)=B(G)B(G)^{\text{T}}$ where $B$ is the oriented incidence matrix of $G$.  The suggested lower bound (2) produces the well known bound:

$\Delta+2-1=\Delta+1\leq \lambda_{\max}(L(G))$.

So I suppose the question can be thought of as: is there a nice relationship between the oriented incidence matrix row/column sums and the Laplacian eigenvalues similar to (1) and (2)?

90744,"Lets define a discrete analytic function such a function that is equal to its Newton series:

$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{x}k \Delta^k f\left (0\right)$$

Is function $g(x)=e^{f(x)}$ also discrete-analytic?

This question arose from the following considerations.

As you know the difference equation 

$$\Delta y(x) = F(x)$$ 

has multiple solutions that differ only by an arbitrary 1-periodic function $C(x)$:

$$y(x)=y_1(x)+C(x)$$

At the same time there can be no more than one (up to a constant term) discrete-analytic solution which we can consider to be the natural solution of the equation.

But when considering multiplicative-difference equation $\frac{y(x+1)}{y(x)}=F(x)$ we come to a similar situation this equation has multiple solutions which differ by an arbitrary 1-periodic factor:

$$y(x)=C(x)y_1(x)$$

Of these solutions similarly no more than one (up to a constant factor) is discrete-analytic which allows us to define the distinguished solution.

But on the other hand the following rule holds for indefinite product and sum:

$$\prod_x f(x)= e^{\sum_x \ln f(x)}$$

This means that we can obtain the solution to the equation $\frac{y(x+1)}{y(x)}=F(x)$ in the following form:

$$y(x)=e^{\sum_x \ln F(x)}$$

This allows us to select the distinguished solution by another method that is taking the natural solution to the sum and taking exponent of it. The result will have a constant factor but it is unevident whether it will be discrete-analytic or not and as such whether the both distinguished solutions coincide.

UPDATE

Due to the answer by David Speyer it is evident now that counter-examples exist among complex-valued functions and also there are instances when function $f(x)$ is discrete-analytic while the Newton series of its exponent does not converge.

So the question should be formulated more precisely: we assume that $f(x)$ is real-valued and Newton series for its exponent converges.

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a topological space satisfying the conditions to be a topological $n$-manifold (locally euclidean Hausdorff second countable).

Given that Moise's Theorem permits that there is an essentially unique piece-wise linear structure how can I learn about the correlation between this linear structure and the fundamental domain of $\mathcal{M}$? I can't come up with any connections but for motivations to do with Theoretical Physics I suspect that the structure guaranteed by Moise's Theorem and the fundamental domain are related (I won't digress).

where $M_{\mathbb{C}}(X)$ are smooth CY-deformations of $X$ and $M_{K}(X')$ is the 'stringy' Kahler resolutions of $X'$. The homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich predicts an equivalence of categories $D^b(coh(X_c))\simeq D(Fuk(X'_{c'}))$ where $c\leftrightarrow c'$ under the bijection on the moduli spaces. The problem is that there are singular Calabi-Yau varieties without any smooth deformations or any smooth crepant resolutions. So the homological mirror symmetry conjecture doesn't seem to have a lot of substance in these cases. An insight of Michael Van den Bergh is that every Calabi-Yau variety should have a noncommutative deformation or noncommutative crepant resolution. Then under the bijection on moduli spaces it is then possible for a noncommutative deformation to map to commutative Kahler resolution and vice verse. To extend homological mirror conjecture to include these noncommutative spaces it seems plausible to define the category of coherent sheaves on a noncommutative space using finitely generated projective modules.

Problem statement

Let $V$ be an arbitrary $k$-dimensional vector subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.  Let $X\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ be a symmetric matrix  whose column space is contained in $V$.  Now I add constraints to X: given some pairs $(ij)$ such that $1\leq i &lt; j\leq n$ I need $X_{ij}=0$.  How many of these zero constraints can I satisfy before the only solution is $X=0$?

I've found a sufficient condition for a non-zero solution to exist: the number of constraints $q$ must satisfy $q&lt; \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.  I think its also a necessary condition but I could use a hand in showing that.

Proof of sufficient condition

Let $M_V$ be the space of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices whose column space is contained in $V$.  An orthonormal basis for $M_V$ is $\{\frac{1}{2}Q(e_ie_j^T+e_je_i^T)Q^T : 1\leq i \leq j \leq n\}$ where the columns of $Q\in\mathbb R^{n\times k}$ form an orthonormal basis for $V$ and $e_i$ are the standard basis vectors for $\mathbb R^k$ so $\dim(M_V)=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

Let $M_X$ be the space of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices that satisfy the $q$ zero constraints.  Now suppose no non-zero $X$ satisfying the constraints exist: this implies $M_V\cap M_X=\{0\}$.

90837,"My question refers to the paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/alg-geom/9710020.pdf where Batyrev proves that birational Calabi-Yau algebraic varieties have equal Betti numbers by counting points over finite fields using p-adic integration and so computes the Betti numbers using the Weil conjectures.

It seems that he is doing the following. Given a variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ we can actually write it (and all the associated data we care about) as a variety $\mathcal{X}$ over $\mathcal{R}$ some finite-type $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra: i.e. such that $\mathcal{X} \otimes_\mathcal{R} \mathbb{C} = X$. We then fix an approriate maximal ideal $J(\pi)$ of $\mathcal{R}$ which lies above $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. I think we then turn our attention to the variety $\mathcal{X}\otimes_\mathcal{R} (\mathcal{R}/J(\pi))$ and using a ring of integers $R$ of a local number field with this as special fibre we can count the number of points this variety has over every finite field extension of $\mathbb{F}_q = \mathcal{R}/J(\pi)$ using p-adic integration.

So the Weil conjectures give us the Betti numbers of this variety and by proper smooth base change these Betti numbers are the same as those of $\mathcal{X} \otimes_\mathcal{R} \mathbb{C}$ but where the map $\mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is not the natural inclusion but rather $\mathcal{R} \rightarrow R \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Since he is trying to compute the cohomology of the former this doesn't make sense to me.

Can anyone see if I'm making a mistake somewhere? (or how my issue can be resolved?)

90862,"Many famous problems in mathematics can be phrased as the quest for a specific construction. Often such constructions were sought after for centuries or even millennia and later proved impossible by taking a new ""higher"" perspective. The most obvious example would be the three geometric problems of antiquity: squaring of circles duplication of cubes and trisection of angles by ruler and compass alone. Closely related to these three is the construction of regular $n$-gons for general $n$. Later we have the solution of an arbitrary algebraic equation by means of radicals or the expression of the circumference of an ellipse by means of elementary functions. In the 20th century we have Hilbert's tenth problem: find an algorithm to determine whether a given diophantine equation has solutions.

All these constructions turned out to be impossible but the futile search produced some new and great mathematics: Galois theory group theory transcendental numbers elliptic curves ...

But I am looking for examples which are in some sense the opposite of the above: where somebody turned up with an ingenious construction in a problem where it had been generally believed that no such construction should exist. Ideally this construction should have made new interesting questions and methods turn up but I am also interested in isolated results that may just be counted as funny coincidences. To make my point clearer let me present my own two favourite examples.

(1) Belyi's Theorem: If $X$ is a smooth projective algebraic curve defined over a number field there exists a rational function on $X$ whose only singular values are $0$ $1$ and $\infty$. --- According to his Esquisse d'un programme Grothendieck had thought about this problem shortly before but found the statement so bold that he even felt awkward for asking Deligne about it. To put the theorem into context the converse statement (that every curve which admits a rational function with only these three singular values can be defined over a number field) had been known before by abstract nonsense and is quite straightforward to deduce from deep results in Grothendieck-style algebraic geometry. Belyi's proof however was completely elementary constructive and tricky. Also it is more important than it might seem at first sight since it opens up a very strict and equally unexpected connection between the topology of surfaces and number theory.

(2) Julia Robinson's theorem about the definability of integers: Suppose you want to single out $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ using as little structure as possible. The result in question is at least to me absolutely striking. I do not know if it was so unexpected to the experts at that time but the construction is in any case really ingenious. It says that there exists a first-order formula $\varphi$ in the language of rings (i.e. only talking about elements not subsets and using only logical symbols and multiplication and addition and the symbols $0$ and $1$) such that for a rational number $r$ $\varphi (r)$ is true if and only if $r$ is an integer. Robinson's original formula is
$$\varphi (r)\equiv\forall y\forall z(\psi (0yz)\wedge\forall x(\psi (xyz)\longrightarrow \psi (x+1yz))\longrightarrow\psi (ryz))$$
with
$$\psi (xyz) \equiv \exists a\exists b\exists c(2 + x^2yz = a^2 + yb^2-zc^2).$$
Since this is not my area of research I do not attempt to estimate the historical importance of this discovery but it seems to me that it is of great weight in the intersection of number theory and logic.

So I hope these two examples make it clear what I am after and I am looking forward to reading your examples.

In particular I am interested in the generic case when the holomorphic discs in $\operatorname{Sym}^g\Sigma$ are as ""bad"" as possible.  I have searched online for some examples of ""generic""/""complicated"" Whitney disks in the symmetric product but most papers I see deal with special cases (namely where one can see by inspection and the Riemann mapping theorem that certain homotopy classes of Whitney disks are uniquely representable by holomorphic disks).

To elaborate on what I mean by ""complicated"" holomorphic disks let's recall a certain (now standard) perspective on the Whitney disks.  If we have a holomorphic disk $\phi:\mathbb D^2\to\operatorname{Sym}^g\Sigma$ then we can consider the fiber product:
$$\begin{matrix}
S&amp;\xrightarrow{\tilde\phi}&amp;\Sigma\times\operatorname{Sym}^{g-1}\Sigma\cr
\downarrow&amp; &amp;\downarrow\cr
\mathbb D^2&amp;\xrightarrow\phi &amp;\operatorname{Sym}^g\Sigma
\end{matrix}$$
Then $S\to\mathbb D^2$ is a $g$-fold ramified cover (and the fiber over a point $p\in\mathbb D^2$ is ""the $g$ points in $\Sigma$ given by $\phi(p)$"").  Thus another way of viewing holomorphic disks in $\operatorname{Sym}^g\Sigma$ is as $g$-fold ramified maps $S\to\mathbb D^2$ along with a map $S\to\Sigma$.  Thus even though we consider only disks mapping to $\operatorname{Sym}^g\Sigma$ moduli spaces of more complicated Riemann surfaces naturally come in to play in Heegaard Floer Homology as moduli of the ramified cover $S$.

I am interested in the following ""complicated"" behaviour of $S$ and of the map $\tilde\phi:S\to\Sigma$:


Can the map $S\to\Sigma$ fail to be an immersion? (I believe the answer is yes; in fact I think I know where to look for more information on this I just haven't followed up on it yet).
In general what do the ""slits"" or ""cuts"" along the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ curves look like in $S$ and how does $S$ degenerate as these slits vary in length?

(this is a bit vague but if someone has an enlightening example I'd really like to see it)
Can $S$ have positive genus?  This is the question I'm really most interested in.  I have on good authority that the answer is yes so actually what I really want is an example where $S$ has positive genus and contributes to the differential (or at least has Maslov index one).

Inconsistency of the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice and its effects on the computational complexity by M. Kim Mar. 2012.


  Abstract. This paper exposes a contradiction in the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). While Godel's incompleteness theorems state that a consistent system cannot prove its consistency they do not eliminate proofs using a stronger system or methods that are outside the scope of the system. The paper shows that the cardinalities of infinite sets are uncontrollable and contradictory. The paper then states that Peano arithmetic or first-order arithmetic is inconsistent if all of the axioms and axiom schema assumed in the ZFC system are taken as being true showing that ZFC is inconsistent. The paper then exposes some consequences that are in the scope of the computational complexity theory.

They then need to show that the $\cal H$-unit ball is definable in $M$ using a first order language with symbols for vector addition and membership of the $M$-unit ball. With this in view in their Lemma 2.9 they claim certain of the vectors $a$ are definable but they don't have what they need to apply the lemma they appeal to for this (they have an inequality $\|b\| \le (1 - \delta)^{-1}$ but their Lemma 2.3 needs the opposite inequality).

This paper: Frontier Search describes a way to solve the same problem with $O(|E|log|P|)$ time and $O(S)$ space where $|P|$ is the length of the shortest path between $v_1$ and $v_2$ and $S$ is the cardinality of the largest sphere centered at $v_1$ (a sphere on the graph as a metric space the length of each edge is $1$).

This is a major space reduction when the graph is essentially a layers graph with the largest layer being much smaller than the number of vertices in the graph.

I am wondering if this can be useful in searching for shortest paths in Cayley graphs.

For example taking the group $\mathbb{Z_n} \times \mathbb{Z}_n$ with generators $(10)$ and $(01)$ we get that the cardinality of the largest sphere is $O(n)$ while the number of vertices in the graph is $O(n^2)$. Ofcourse this is a silly example because finding shortest paths in this Cayley graph is straightforward.

Another example is the Heisenberg group modulo an odd prime $p$ which with the standard generators described in Wikipedia gives a Cayley graph of size $O(p^3)$ and a largest layer of size $O(p^2)$ (If I am not mistaken). This example is just a little less silly than the previous one but only a little because again - shortest paths on this graph can be found rather easily without performing any search.

I am looking for examples where this search method can be useful.

  Then I am looking for a sequence of finite groups $(G_{i})_{i=1}^{\infty}$ such that $|G_i|$ increases but $LS(G_i)/|G_i| \overset{i \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} 0$ and there is no known efficient way to find shortest paths in the Cayley graphs of the groups $G_i$ (with some set of generators).


This idea also applies to infinite groups (with a set of generators) where spheres are much smaller than balls of the same radius so such examples can be useful too (as long as finding shortest paths in their Cayley graphs is hard to do efficiently). A non-example would be the free group with 2 generators. A silly example would be the free abelian group with 2 generators. I know very little about growth rates of groups but maybe any group with polynomial growth is an example?

I am interested in the question I posed in the title and this article is really confusing me.

It states there that


  A model of the Peano axioms is a triple $(\mathbb{N} 0 S)$ where $\mathbb{N}$ an infinite set $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $S : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ satisfies the axioms. Dedekind proved in his 1888 book What are numbers and what should they do (German: Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are isomorphic. In particular given two models $(\mathbb{N}_A 0_A S_A)$ and $(\mathbb{N}_B 0_B S_B)$ of the Peano axioms there is a unique homomorphism $f : \mathbb{N}_A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_B$ satisfying $$f(0_A)=0_B$$ and $$f(S_{A}(n))=S_{B}(f(n))$$ and it is a bijection.

90933,"Just to put things in perspective recall that the Hopf Conjecture asks whether $S^2\times S^2$ admits a metric of positive sectional curvature. By the work of Hsiang-Kleiner it is known that if $S^2\times S^2$ admits such a metric then its isometry group cannot contain a circle and is hence finite.


  Q: If $S^2\times S^2$ admits a metric with $sec>0$ what is known about its isometry group $G$?




The only results I know of are:

0) [Edit suggested by Misha] The diagonal antipodal action of $\mathbb Z_2$ on $S^2\times S^2$ i.e. $\pm 1\cdot(xy)=(\pm x\pm y)$ cannot be isometric if $S^2\times S^2$ is equipped with a metric of positive curvature. By Weinstein's Thm an orientation-preserving isometry of an even-dimensional positively curved manifold has a fixed point (and the antipodal map does not). Equivalently it would induce a positively curved metric on the $2$-fold orientable cover of $\mathbb R P^2\times \mathbb R P^2$ hence on $\mathbb R P^2\times \mathbb R P^2$ but this contradicts Synge's Thm.

1) From Wilking's thesis (Prop 4.2) any simple subgroup of $G$ is either cyclic or isomorphic to a group in a finite list $F_1\dotsF_k$ of simple groups. (This is actually true for any finitely generated subgroups of isometries of a manifold with $Ricâ¥0$).

2) From Fang's paper (Thm 1.2) $G$ cannot have a subgroup of sufficiently large odd order (but this lower bound is huge since it is estimated with Gromov's universal constant for the total Betti number).



Apart from these are there other known restrictions on what $G$ can be like?

90934,"In S.C. Kleene's 1935 paper ""$\lambda$-definability and recursiveness"" he proves that all $\lambda$-definable functions are general recursive in the Herbrand-Godel sense and vice-versa. However the exact choice of definition for $\lambda$-definable is a bit confusing for me. He differentiates between well-formed formulas (wff) and properly formed formulas (pff). Wffs are  pffs where in each properly formed part $\lambda x[M]$ $x$ must appear as a free symbol in $M$. For example $\lambda x \cdot x$ is both a wff and a pff but $\lambda x \cdot y$ is only a pff. He then goes on to define $\lambda$-definable functions using a Church encoding.

All modern sources that I've found on the $\lambda$-calculus are only concerned with properly formed formulas. Kleene himself notes in a footnote that by only considering pffs 


  ...simplifications are afforded in the
  proofs of many theorems but
  unfortunately difficulties are
  introduced in the formal logics in
  which this theory is used. Rosser has
  shown that the formal definition ($\lambda$-K-definition) under this program is equivalent to $\lambda$-definition when the range of the independent variable is the set of natural numbers and all the values have the same free symbols. For functions over all well-formed formulas $\lambda$-K-definition is not equivalent to $\lambda$-definition but we conjecture that the equivalence holds for many other significant ranges...


I would like to know more about this. It seems that what we today call the untyped $\lambda$-calculus was the $\lambda$-K-calculus to Kleene and Church. I can see why many of the proofs are much simpler in the $\lambda$-K-calculus.  My questions are:

What do we gain by only considering the well-formed formulas (""difficulties are introduced in the formal logics..."")?

Does the equivalence still hold between $\lambda$-K-definable functions and Herbrand-Godel general recursive functions?

$h$ is a map from $E$ to the set of finite subsets of $V$ (so $V$ is the set of vertices $E$ the set of hyperedge-labels and $h$ yields the hyperedge of a hyperedge-label).

90943,"Right now I am reading ""Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic"" by Goldblatt. I am at the section where he explains the concept of products by first looking at an example from Set (not using specific sets just an abstract A and B) and then defining what a product in a category is.

So in getting the concept down I figured I would do actual examples and even non-examples myself. His second example is that in Grp the category of groups a product is the direct group product of groups the binary operation done component-wise. He doesn't use specific groups just says that the direct group product is a categorial product.

Well I figured that $Z_8$ not being isomorphic to $Z_2$ X $Z_4$ in Grp (though as merely sets are bijective) would be a great non-example of a product (since products are all merely isomorphic anyway they form a class of objects right? so there might be more than one of them?)
I had trouble doing commutative diagrams in latex but this was my set up:

$pr_2\colon Z_2$ X $Z_4 \to Z_2$

$pr_4\colon Z_2$ X $Z_4 \to Z_4$

And here my ""auxilary"" object and its homomorphisms:

$f\colon Z_8 \to Z_2$

$g\colon Z_8 \to Z_4$

$(fg)\colon Z_8 \to Z_2$ X $Z_4$

Where f could either be the trivial homomorphism or x mod 2 and similarly for g.

But no matter what I fill in for f and g (fg) seems to not only be defined and commute the diagram but unique.
However given the group homomorphisms from $[Z_8 Z_2]$ and $[Z_8 Z_4]$ (fg) is clearly not an isomorphism even if we were to forget the group structure but not iso even as a homomorphism yet the product arrow is supposed to be iso.

When first coming to the concept from the book days ago I was confused if whether or not the auxilary object too was a product but I was confident that I understood that it too is a product and confident that I was following the logic of the author's text in the language of category theory just by following the ""mechanical manipulation of symbols"" for example on the next page he proves that all product objects are iso to each other and I felt I was able to follow his argument.

I guess my question is what am I not understanding in the definition of a product in category theory? How does it entail the product from specific categories such as Grp and Top and further properties like the product arrows being iso's in the specific categories? And how would that explanation/understanding correct whatever mistake I made with the above example?

90952,"Simple BIBD are defined as those designs in which incindence relation is ""is element"". So effectively blocks are subsets of points. Equivalently there should be no ""repeating blocks"" ie. blocks that aren't uniquely determined by its 'elements' (here 'elements' means in sense of incidence relation).

For fixed block $B_0$ (Block-)residual designs (of symmetric $(vk\lambda)$-design $(\mathcal{P}\mathcal{B}\mathcal{I})$=(pointsblocksrelation)) is defined as incidence structure with points $\mathcal{P}\setminus B_0$ and blocks $ \{ B \setminus B_0 : B\in \mathcal{B} B\neq B_0 \} $ and incidence inherited from initial design.

This residual design is allowed to have repeted blocks (ie. not to be simple). In that case parameters of derived design are $(v-kk-\lambda\lambda)$. 

But from a few simple examples it seems that  if there are any repeated blocks than there is fixed $f$ such that every block is repeated exactly $f$ times. So we can simply exclude those repated blocks and get SIMPLE $(v-kk-\lambda\frac{\lambda}{f})$ design.

Is this true? If not what is counter-example? If it is in fact true how to prove it?

Additionaly we suppose that $k-\lambda\geq 2$.



EDIT (clarification):
Maybe I wasn't clear enough. Bottom line is that if you start with SIMPLE SYMMETRIC BIBD $(\mathcal{P}\mathcal{B}\in)$ with $k-\lambda \geq 2$ is it true that ""residual design"" $(\mathcal{P}\setminus B_0\{ B \setminus B_0 : B\in \mathcal{B} B\neq B_0 \}\in)$ is DESIGN AT ALL?! (Note that here same blocks merge into one block since relation is '$\in$'). It will be if it is true that there is  fixed $f$ such that every block is repeated exactly $f$ times if we interpret $\{ B \setminus B_0 : B\in \mathcal{B} B\neq B_0 \}$ as multiset.

It isn't hard to prove that if $\lambda=1$ (since we have $kâ\lambda\geq 2$) this is true and there aren't repeated blocks ie. $f=1$.

A user asked in a comment whether this implies that an arbitrary product of zero-dimensional rings is zero dimensional.
I answered that indeed this is true and follows from  von Neumann regularity if the rings are all reduced but I gave the following counterexample in the non reduced case:    

Let $R$ be the product ring $R=\prod_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb Z/2^n\mathbb Z$.
Every $\mathbb Z/2^n\mathbb Z$ is zero dimensional but $R$ has $\gt 0$ dimension.  

My argument was that its Jacobson radical  $Jac(R)=\prod_{n=1}^\infty Jac (\mathbb Z/2^n\mathbb Z)=\prod_{n=1}^\infty2\mathbb Z/2^n\mathbb Z$ contains the non-nilpotent element $(22\cdots2\cdots)$.
However in a zero dimensional ring the Jacobson  radical and the nilpotent radical  coincide and thus   $R$ must have positive dimension.    

My question is then simply: we know that $dim(R)\gt 0$ but what is the exact Krull dimension of $R$ ?

91001,"Hi

Suppose that I have two nxn similarity matrices. These matrices contain similarity information between n items. Although both matrices contain similarities of the same n items they do not contain the same similarity values. This might be because the similarities between the items are calculated using different information.

I want to know how similar these matrices are. One simple thing is to find the frobenius distance between the two matrices. But this might be misleading I think. 

Are there better ways? What I want to understand whether the structure contained in the two similarity matrices are similar or not.

Let me clarify what I mean by a similarity matrix. Suppose that we have n items. And suppose that each item i is represented with a vector of numbers. Then each element of the similarity matrix $S(ij) = cosine(v_i v_j)$  where $v_i$ and $v_j$ are the $ith$ and $jth$ item vectors and  $cosine(v_i v_j)$ is the cosine of the angle between $v_i$ and $v_j$. (Distance metrics other then cosine may also be used)

May be I should have used distance matrix instead of similarity matrix.

there is one type of regular languages over ${ab}$ which appear naturally in what I am studying so if anybody could recognise them or say any sort of their characterisation that would be great.

So our languages $L\subseteq (a+b)^*$ are defined as follows:

(0) First we choose some $n\geq 0$ and new letters $x_1\ldotsx_n$ (if $n=0$ then we just basically don't choose any new letters);

(1) We choose words $w_i\in (a+b)^*$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$;

(2) Let $\phi$ be the homomorphism lifting the assignment $a\mapsto a$ $b\mapsto b$ $x_i\mapsto w_i$;

(3) Find a finite set $F$ from $(a+b+x_1+\cdots+x_n)^*$;

(4) Let $K=(a+b+x_1+\cdots+x_n)^{*}-(a+b+x_1+\cdots+x_n)^{*}F(a+b+x_1+\cdots+x_n)^{*}$

Denote by $P$ the proper transform under $f$ of a hyperplane in $Y$.

I am trying to calculate $c_2(\tilde Y)$ and with the help of a post here at MO I thought that I had figured it out. However I wanted to do a quick check if nothing went wrong but something did go wrong. Assume $n=4$ and $d=2$ then we can use the formula from Fulton's book in Example 15.4.3 to get
$$c_2(\tilde Y)=f^\ast c_2(Y) - j_\ast g^\ast c_1(X) - E^2.$$
By the answer to my question by Johannes NordstrÃ¶m we can write $j_\ast g^\ast c_1(X)=3(E^2 + EP)$ and this yields
$$c_2(\tilde Y)=10P^2 - 3EP -  4E^2.$$
Now we also know from the same example in Fulton's book that $c_1(\tilde Y)=f^\ast c_1(Y) - E=5P-E$. Since the blow-up map $f$ is finite of degree one the degrees of $c_1^2(\tilde Y)c_2(\tilde Y)$ and $c_1^2(Y)c_2(Y)$ should coincide. Because I was unsure of the calculation I asked a second question and obtained the answer that
$$P^{n-b} E^b = (-1)^{b-1+n-d} \cdot \binom{b-1}{n-d}$$
Now we can put this all together and obtain
$$\begin{align*}
c_1^2(\tilde Y)c_2(\tilde Y) &amp;= (5P-E)^2(10P^2 - 3EP - 4E^2)
\\&amp;= 250P^4 - 175P^3E - 60P^2E + 37PE^3 - 4E^4
\\&amp;= 250 + 37 + 12 = 299
\end{align*}$$
but $c_1^2(Y)c_2(Y)=(4+1)^2\cdot\frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 250$.

91132,"This is mainly a request for a straightforward reference (preferably at textbook level).  The question comes up while responding to a question raised by non-specialists in finite group representations.    

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $F \subset E$ be finite fields say with $E$ a splitting field for $G$ but perhaps $F$ not.    Starting with a simple module $M$ of dimension $d$ for the group algebra $E[G]$ consider the $F[G]$-module $N$ obtained by ""restriction of scalars"" from $M$:  here $M$ as a vector space over $F$ typically has larger dimension related to $d$ while the representing matrices for $G$ over $F$ involve a rewriting of the matrices over $E$.   While this is elementary in principle it's a bit complicated to write down in practice.   In the process one could chart a precise relationship between simple modules over the field $F$ (maybe not a splitting field) and those over $E$.  


  Is this written down clearly for non-specialists?


Going the other way from a module over an arbitrary field $F$ to one over a splitting field $E$ is a more standard topic in textbooks about which much can be said in prime characteristic as well as in characteristic 0 (where the Schur index becomes a leading idea).    See for example the extensive discussion in Chapter 9 ""Changing the field"" in Character Theory of Finite Groups by I.M. Isaacs along with the following chapter.   But I don't recall seeing comparable detail on restriction of scalars.   The question I've been discussing with colleagues isn't especially deep or advanced but a clear reference would help.

ADDED: To make the situation more precise it may be enough (following Geoff) to assume that $F$ is not a splitting field for the given simple $E[G]$-module $M$ while $E$ is a minimal splitting field for it.   (Or you might just take $E$ to be a minimal splitting field for $G$.)   Then if $[E:F] = n$ the restricted $F[G]$-module $N$ has dimension $nd$ over $F$.   In this situation one expects $N$ to be simple for the smaller group algebra which in turn yields an $nd$-dimensional module over $E$ after tensoring etc.   The fields involved being finite there is no Schur index complication and the Galois group of $E/F$ is easy to work with.   So the matrix version over $F$ of the given representation over $E$ should be readily described in block form.   With luck this is all I've been asked to explain in special cases but it would be reassuring to see a concise published version which I couldn't readily extract from books I've seen.

91135,"There appear to be two different nested interval properties for the reals with the punchline ""... then the intersection of the intervals is non-empty"" and I'd like to know their respective histories (and the appropriate terminology to use for distinguishing between them).  Here I am not concerned with the issue of ""singleton-icity"" of the intersection; only non-emptiness.

In one version (which I believe is due to Cantor) the length of the intervals is assumed to shrink down to 0; in the other version their lengths are not constrained.

One sense in which the two properties are inequivalent is that there are non-archimedean ordered fields that satisfy the first but not the second.  (Side question: Which is the preferred spelling ""archimedean"" or ""archimedian""?  The number of Google hits for each spelling is about 800000 so we can't use the Google-hits heuristic to decide though Google seems to think that the former is preferred.)  Specifically consider the ordered field of formal Laurent series in $x$ over the reals ""ordered by size at zero"" (so that effectively we're adjoining a formal infinitesimal $x$ to the reals).  This ordered field satisfies the first nested interval property but not the second.  (Consider the closed intervals $[nx1/n]$.  Their intersection is empty but this doesn't contradict the first version of the nested interval property because the lengths of these intervals don't shrink to 0; indeed all the lengths are greater than $x$.)

91137,"Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold with $\text{rank}(E)=\text{dim}(M)$.  For a section $\sigma$ of $E$ with a zero at $p\in M$ define the degree of the zero at $p$ to be the topological degree of the induced map from a small sphere in $T_pM$ to a small sphere in $E_p$.

One motivation for studying degrees of zeros is that they contain information about the topology of $E$.  I think the following is true although I couldn't find a good reference:

Theorem 1 (Hopf index theorem).  Suppose the zeroes of $\sigma$ are the isolated points $p_1 \ldots p_k$ with degrees $d_1\ldots d_k$ respectively.  Then the Euler class of $E$ is $\chi(E)=\sum_{i=1}^kd_i$.

With this as motivation my first question the one stated in the title is roughly (see the Example for an idea of what I'm getting at and feel free to suggest a sharper version):


Are there conditions on [say the symbol of] a linear differential operator $D:E\to F$ such that [some constraint] is satisfied by degree of any zero $p\in M$ of any local solution $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ to the PDE $D\sigma=0$?


Example. If $M$ is a Riemann surface and $E$ a holomorphic line bundle over it the kernel of the delbar operator $\overline{\partial}:E\to T^{01}M\otimes E$ is precisely the holomorphic sections of $E$.  By complex analysis zeroes of holomorphic functions have positive degree.

Theorem 1 then yields the standard result that if a line bundle admits a global holomorphic section then its Euler class (aka first Chern class) is nonnegative.



Here's an idea I had for trying to prove a theorem of the sort I ask for in Question 1.  Recall the definition of the local ring of a zero $p\in M$ of a section of E: 

Write  $\mathcal{O}_p$ for the ring of germs of smooth functions about $p$.

Definition.  Let $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ be a smooth section which vanishes at $p$.  The local ring of the germ $[\sigma]_p$ denoted $Q([\sigma]_p)$ is the quotient $\mathcal{O}_p/([\sigma]_p)$ where $([\sigma]_p)$ is the ideal of $\mathcal{O}_p$ generated by ""components of $\sigma$"": $([\sigma]_p)=\ &lt;\{[v(\sigma)]_p:v\text{ a nonvanishing section of }E^*\}&gt; \ \subseteq \mathcal{O}_p$.

Theorem 2 (Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili). Suppose $p$ is a zero of $\sigma$ and the local ring $Q([\sigma]_p)$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over $\mathbb{R}$.  Then there is a canonical quadratic form on $Q([\sigma]_p)$ such that the degree of the zero of $\sigma$ at $p$ can be calculated as this quadratic form's signature. 

Because a system of PDE is precisely a constraint on the local behaviour of a section it seems plausible that local rings of zeros of solutions of a PDE might have interesting properties.


Are there conditions on [say the symbol of] a linear differential operator $D:E\to F$ such that [some constraint] is satisfied by the signature of the local ring $Q([\sigma]_p)$ of any zero $p\in M$ of any local solution $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ to the PDE $D\sigma=0$?


Example.  As in the previous example let $E$ be a holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface $M$.  By manipulating the Cauchy-Riemann equations one can (I think!) classify the possible local rings of zeroes of a holomorphic section and show that all of them have positive signature.  

Theorem 2 then yields an alternative proof of the quoted result that zeroes of holomorphic functions have positive degree.

which diverges when $p\leq 1$. And if $n>1$ we have that $1/n&lt;1$ so one of the sums in the process of evaluation becomes divergent.

It is a nice exercise for high-school students to prove that any positive rational number less than 1 can be written as a sum of unitary fractions with distinct denominators.

in some cases since nq-p can be equal to p-1 it seems possible that one cannot write p/q as a sum of less than p unitary fractions. Is it true that one can find such a fraction for any integer p ?
finding a sum of unitary fractions which is equal to a fraction p/q is not difficult but is it easy to find the sum with a minimum number of fractions ? And the sum which minimize the sum of denominators ?

Edit

Having looked a bit at probability books in paticular Kallenberg's Foundations of Modern Probability (2nd ed chapter 24) I found the following:

Using a linear transformation $T:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ one reduces to an uncorrelated 
BM and a parallelogram $D=D_\rho$ instead of a square. If $g:D\times D\to\mathbb R$ is the Green function of $D$ and $\tau_x=\inf\lbrace t>0: x+ B_t\notin D\rbrace$ then (by Kallenberg page 477 with $f=1$ originally this is probably due to Hunt) we get
$$ E(\tau_x)= \int g(xy) dy.$$
In principle it would thus be enough (but it might be overkill) to know the Green function of a parallelogram. Perhaps this can be calculated using Schwarz-Christoffel formulas. Nevertheless I do not see to what kind of formula for $E(\tau)=E(\tau_0)=f(\rho)$ this may lead.

Assuming such a generalization exists how does this affect the geometric definition of an $(\infty1)$-category? Is there no longer a capturing of the geometric model desired from simplicial sets or can something more general than an $(\infty1)$-category be defined?

Examples I have in mind are the representation of dimension 1 of a group $G$ over a field $k$ which correspond in one hand to one dimensional $k$-vector space in the topos of $G$-set and on the other hand to the cohomology group $H^1(G-setk^*) $.
Or the principal bundle over a topological space $X$ which corresponds to some $H^1(XG)$ too.

91237,"This is a question whose motivation and framing seem to involve a lot of topology but which I suspect comes down to some simple and standard combinatorics that's probably recorded in a book somewhere. To draw in the nLab people I'll say that I also considered entitling this ""categorifying Mobius inversion"".

Let $X$ be a topological space and let $U_i$ $i \in I$ be a finite collection of open sets of $X$ such that


$X = \bigcup U_i$
For any two sets $U_i$ and $U_j$ in the collection $U_i \cap U_j$ is also in the collection.


Suppose that I know all of the $H^{\ast}(U_i)$'s and all of the restriction maps between them and I would like to compute $H^{\ast}(X)$. 

One way is to compute $H^{\ast}(U_1)$ then $H^{\ast}(U_1 \cup U_2)$ then $H^{\ast}(U_1 \cup U_2 \cup U_3)$ and so forth successively using Mayer-Vietoris to put in each new set.

I can also do it all in one go by using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence. Let $J \subseteq I$ be the set of indices $j$ such that $U_j$ is not contained in any other $U_i$. As explained here one way to think of this is that we have an exact complex of sheaves. 
$$0 \to \mathbb{Z}(X )\to \bigoplus_{j \in J} \mathbb{Z}(U_j) \to \bigoplus_{j_1 j_2 \in J} \mathbb{Z}(U_{j_1} \cap U_{j_2}) \to \cdots \quad (\ast)$$
(See the comments on that question for issues about whether one should be using the extension by zero or the pushforward; which I'm not sure ever got resolved. I should probably get that right at some point but it isn't what I want to focus on so we can switch to covers by closed sets if that will avoid focusing on that point.)

It seems like sometimes one can use knowledge of the relations between the $U$'s to shorten the resolution $(\ast)$. For example suppose that $U_1 \cap U_2 = U_1 \cap U_3 = U_2 \cap U_3 = U_4$. Then the complex $(\ast)$ looks like
$$0 \to \mathbb{Z}(X) \to \mathbb{Z}(U_1) \oplus \mathbb{Z}(U_2) \oplus \mathbb{Z}(U_3) \to \mathbb{Z}(U_4)^{\oplus 3} \to \mathbb{Z}(U_4) \to 0.$$
But there is a shorter resolution
$$0 \to \mathbb{Z}(X) \to \mathbb{Z}(U_1) \oplus \mathbb{Z}(U_2) \oplus \mathbb{Z}(U_3) \to \mathbb{Z}(U_4)^{\oplus 2} \to 0. \quad (\ast \ast)$$

Let $I$ be the poset of containment relations between the $U_i$. (Since the collection $U_i$ is closed under intersection $I$ has joins and if we adjoin an extra minimal element $0$ of $I$ then $I$ is a lattice.) I am looking for a recipe which would look at the poset $I$ and spit out the complex $(\ast \ast)$.

Mobius inversion tells me that the sheaf $\mathbb{Z}(U_i)$ should be used ""$\mu(0i)$ times"" where $\mu$ is the Mobius function and the scare quotes are because using $U_i$ in an odd cohomological degree counts negatively. For example the double occurrence of $U_4$ in $(\ast \ast)$ reflects that $\mu(02) = 2$ for this poset. So this is why I say that I want to ""categorify Mobius inversion"" -- I want to turn that number into a vector space (or collection of vector spaces).

Thanks!

Definition: We say that the function $T:\mathbb{Q}^* \to \mathbb{Q}^*$ is a uniform transformation (with respect to $\sim$) if and only if for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}^*$ we have $(xTx) \sim (TxTTx)$.

We also have analogous definitions when restricting attention to $\mathbb{Q}^k$ (note that a uniform transformation necessarily restricts to a function $\mathbb{Q}^k \to \mathbb{Q}^k$ for all $k$).

This definition is due to Harvey Friedman (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2012-March/016316.html) and I can only guess that the latter condition involving $(xTx)$ involves concatenation of strings [EDIT: it cannot be concatenation see Aaron's comment below. If anyone can reverse engineer a definition that would be great. I'll see if I can get Friedman to clarify]. Friedman arrived at this definition by abstracting the required properties of a function he calls $\mathbb{Z}^+\!\!\uparrow$ - it takes a finite string finds the first entry which is not a positive integer and then adds 1 to all entries after that. For example. 

$$\mathbb{Z}^+\!\!\uparrow(13/235) = (13/246).$$

[EDIT 2: my definition of $\mathbb{Z}^+\!\!\uparrow$ is wrong see Aaron's answer. The correct definition is to add 1 to all (necessarily integer) entries larger than the supremum of the non-integer entries.]

Now I was wondering if there are any other examples of uniform transformations. I hope there are because $\mathbb{Z}^+\!\!\uparrow$ looks to me fairly contrived (of course it is contrived) and others Friedman has asked personally have said the same. On the other hand perhaps this function (or one like it) arises naturally from some combinatorial problem. My questions


  A. What are other examples of uniform transformations?
  
  B. Can we arrive at the function $\mathbb{Z}^+\!\!\uparrow$ 'naturally'?

Then I was introduced to homology of groups and now Floer/Morse homologies.  Do these homologies still count ""holes"" in some fashion?
In the case of group homology $H_\ast(G)\cong H_\ast(BG)$ so we can view this homology as a count of holes in the Milnor construction (CW-complex assembled from points in the discrete group with the group structure).
In Floer homology we're counting holomorphic curves (flow-lines in Morse homology) but it isn't viewed as having these curves ""wrap around holes"" so I am not sure if this hole-detecting view of homology breaks down.

[[Edit]]: I will narrow down my question. Are there instances where I can treat $HF_\ast$ as $H_\ast$ of a particular space?  For instance I just realized that with nice conditions we have $HF^\ast(LL)=H^\ast(L)$ in Lagrangian-Floer homology so here it counts the holes of the Lagrangian submanifold.

Given an element $\underline{\lambda}=[\lambda_1\ldots \lambda_n]\in \mathbb{RP}^n$ where $\lambda_1\leq\lambda_2\leq\ldots\lambda_n$ I say that a subspace $W\subset Sym^2(V)$ is a $\underline{\lambda}$-space if every matrix $A\in W$ has eigenvalues $\lambda_1(A)\leq\ldots \lambda_n(A)$ such that $[\lambda_1(A) \ldots\lambda_n(A)]=\underline{\lambda}$. Let $R(\underline{\lambda})$ be the maximal dimension of a $\underline{\lambda}$-space. What I am interested about is the following question:

Question-version 1: Compute $R(\underline{\lambda})$. If not possible find upper bounds on $R(\underline{\lambda})$.

Example: if all the $\lambda_i$'s are nonzero then a $\underline{\lambda}$-space $W$ has the property that any (nonzero) $A\in W$ is nonsingular. The problem of finding the maximal dimension $R_H(n)$ of subspaces of nonsingular $n\times n$ symmetric matrices was studied in ""On matrices whose real linear combinations are non-singular"" by J. F. Adams Peter D. Lax and Ralph S. Phillips. It turns out that $R_H(n)=\rho(n/2)+1$ where $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz function $\big($$\rho(n)-1$ is the number of linearly independent vector fields on $S^{n-1}$$\big)$. In particular this says that $$R(\underline{\lambda})\leq \rho(n/2)+1$$ if $\lambda_i\neq 0\quad \forall i$.



Another version of the same question is maybe more geometric: Consider the space $Sym^2(V)$ with the (polar) action of the orthogonal group $O(V)$ given by conjugation: $$P\cdot A:=PAP^t\quad P\in O(V)\ A\in Sym^2(V).$$

The orbits of this action consist precisely of those matrices which share the same eigenvalues. If $W\subset Sym^2(V)$ is a $\underline{\lambda}$-space then the unit sphere $W^1$ of $W$ is contained in a $O(V)$-orbit. So it is equivalent to ask:

Question-version 2: Given a $O(V)$-orbit $\mathcal{O}$ find the maximal dimension of a round sphere contained in $\mathcal{O}$

On the one hand it feels that these spaces should have ""good upper bounds"" meaning it looks hard to come up with examples. Even finding 1-dimensional examples is a bit less trivial than (I) expected. In fact a matrix $A$ spans a 1-dimensional $\underline{\lambda}$-space for some $\underline{\lambda}$ if and only if the eigenvalues of $A$ are symmetric around $0$ i.e. if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue then $-\lambda$ is an eigenvalue as well with the same multiplicity. On the other hand there are geometric situation (where unfortunately it is hard to compute things directly) that prove the existence of high dimensional $\underline{\lambda}$-subspaces for very specific $\underline{\lambda}$. Very likely the choice of $\underline{\lambda}$ must be special and the elements of a $W$ should have special relationships among each other. This leads to my last (very vague) question:

Question 2: Given a n integer $k$ and supposing $R(\underline{\lambda})\geq k$ what can I say about $\underline{\lambda}$ and $W$ being a $\underline{\lambda}$-space?

I am pretty much looking for anything that could help: references observations for special cases or why not? complete answers to my questions. :)

Many thanks in advance!

EDIT Even though it doesn't feel too illuminating to me here is a family of examples (all the ones I know essentially).

Let $0&lt; a_1\leq a_2\ldots \leq a_r$ be real numbers and consider an embedding  of $S:\mathbb{R}^n\to Sym^2(\mathbb{R}^{r(n+1)})$ $\underline{x}\mapsto S_{\underline{x}}$ as follows: if $\underline{w}=(\underline{w}_1t_1\underline{w}_2t_2\ldots \underline{w}_rt_r)\in \mathbb{R}^{r(n+1)}$ where $\underline{w}_i\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $t_i\in \mathbb{R}$ then
$$ S_{\underline{x}}=\big(a_1t_1\underline{x} a_1 \langle \underline{x}\underline{w}_1\rangle \ldots a_rt_r\underline{x} a_r\langle\underline{x}\underline{w}_r\rangle\big)$$ where $\langle\rangle$ is the canonical scalar product in $\mathbb{R}^n$. One can check that the image of this space is a $\underline{\lambda}$-space where
$$\underline{\lambda}=[-a_r-a_{r-1}\ldots -a_100\ldots00a_1a_2\ldots a_r].$$ The number of zeroes in $\underline{\lambda}$ is $r(n-1)$.

This example is a slight generalization of a family of examples arising from a geometric situation. Explicitly I have a submanifold $M$ of a sphere a point $p\in M$ and a linear subspace $W$ of the normal space $\nu_pM$ such that in all directions of $W$ the focal points of $M$ arise at the same distances. This means that all the shape operators $S_x$ (which are symmetric endomorphisms of $T_pM$) have the same eigenvalues so they generate a $\underline{\lambda}$-space.

91256,"I am confused about a couple of steps in the proof of the birational invariance of the geometric genus (Theorem II.8.19 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry).

I shall sketch the proof and highlight my doubts.

Let $XX'$ be two birationally equivalent nonsingular projective varieties over a field k.
Hence there is a birational map $X-->X'$ represented by a morphism $f:V\rightarrow X'$ for some largest open subset $V\subset X$.

Along taxonomic lines the proof goes like this:


We first prove that $f$ induces an injective map $f^{\ast}:\Gamma(X'\omega_{X'})\rightarrow \Gamma(V\omega_V)$
Then we prove that the restriction map $\Gamma(X\omega_X)\rightarrow \Gamma(V\omega_V)$ is bijective using the valuative criterion of properness.


From this it follows that $\rho_g(X')\leq \rho_g(X)$ and the reverse inequality follows by simmetry.

In the proof of step 1: the map $f$ induces an isomorphism $U\cong f(U)$ for some open subset $U\subset V\subset X$ and then Hartshorne claims that this implies that f induces an isomorphism $\omega_{V|U}\cong \omega_{X'|f(U)}$. Why is that?

In the proof of step 2: from the valuative criterion of properness it follows that $\textrm{codim }(X\setminus VX)\geq 2$. In order to prove that $\Gamma(X\omega_X)\rightarrow \Gamma(V\omega_V)$ is bijective it suffices to prove it on open sets $U\subset X$ trivializing the canonical sheaf $\omega_{X|U}\cong \mathcal{O}$ namely that $\Gamma(U\mathcal{O}_U)\rightarrow  \Gamma(U\cap V\mathcal{O}_U\cap V)$ is bijective.

Since $X$ is nonsingular from the first remark in the previous paragraph we have that $\textrm{codim }(U\setminus U\cap VU)\geq 2$ and then Hartsorne claims that the result (bijectivity) follows immediately from the fact that for an integrally closed Noetherian domain $A$ we have $A=\bigcap_{\textrm{ht } \mathfrak{p}=1} A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. I do not see this either.

A pretopology is an example of a coverage but much stronger in that the weak pullbacks are required to be pullbacks covering families need to be closed under composition and families consisting of a single isomorphism are covering.

In order to define sheaves it is enough to start with a coverage and indeed there is a very useful coverage on the category $Diff$ of finite dimensional smooth manifolds consisting of good open covers. Also given a topological space and a basis for the topology on it one can define a coverage which is not a pretopology using these subsets.

However the coverage of good open covers on $Diff$ does satisfy the 'covers compose' axiom of a pretopology but not the other two so is not in a sense completely general. What I would like to see is examples of coverages which satisfy zero one or two but not all of the pretopology axioms in various combinations.

But at this point I see to my shame that I miss an explicit example of this! 

Clearly the most dramatic example would be that of a space $Y$ which is homotopy equivalent to a topological monoid $X$ but such $Y$ carries no topological monoid structure at all not to have to go into the equivalence issue. For a while I thought the closed interval could be an example of this (double shame: there are at least two very simple and well known topological monoid structures on $[01]$!) so I'm completely without examples and I do not either know if such a space $Y$ does actually exist at all.

I want to find the number of sub matrices by selecting u1 number of
columns from the first K columns and u2 number of columns from the N-K
columns. 

In order to do this I first select u1 linearly independent columns
randomly from the first K columns and then the next column I choose
from the N-K columns should not belong to the span of the u1 columns. 

This is the logic I have. I can run a simulation in Matlab for this
but I'm finding it difficult to write the mathematical interpretation
of this. 

I would really appreciate if somebody can help me.

Let $\mathfrak{R}$ be a ring then we knew that a free module over $\mathfrak{R}$ is projective. Moreover if $\mathfrak{R}$ is a principal ideal domain then a module over $\mathfrak{R}$ is free if and only if it is projective or if $\mathfrak{R}$ is local then a projective module is free.

We also have a very big question on free properties of projective module over a ring of polynomial that was Serre conjecture and now is Quillen-Suslind's theorem.

I wonder that do we have a general condition for a ring $\mathfrak{R}$ so that every projective module over $\mathfrak{R}$ is also free over $\mathfrak{R}$ which involve all of the cases that mentioned above ?

91357,"Let $X$ be a scheme and $I \subseteq \mathcal{O}_X$ be a quasi-coherent ideal of finite type. The blowing up $\mathrm{Bl}_I(X)$ has the following universal property: It comes with a morphism $p : \mathrm{Bl}_I(X) \to X$ such that $\langle p^*(I) \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{Bl}_I(X)}$ is invertible and for every morphism $f : Y \to X$ such that $\langle f^*(I) \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{O}_Y$ is invertible there is a unique morphism $\tilde{f} : Y \to \mathrm{Bl}_I(X)$ such that $f = p \tilde{f}$. In other words $\mathrm{Bl}_I(X) \to X$ is a final object in the category of $X$-schemes which pull back $I$ to an invertible ideal.

First I thought that this implies that $\mathrm{Bl}_I(X)$ is a representing object of the functor

$\mathrm{Sch}^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{Set}~ Y \mapsto \{f \in \hom(YX) : \langle f^*(I) \rangle \subseteq \mathcal{O}_Y \text{ invertible}\}$

but this is wrong: This is not even a functor! Invertible ideals don't pull back to invertible ideals. If $H(Y)$ denotes the set above then there is a map $\hom(Y\tilde{X}) \to H(Y)$ which is injective but far from being surjective.

Question. Which functor $\mathrm{Sch}^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{Set}$ does the blowing up represent? In other words how can we simplify $\hom(Y\mathrm{Bl}_I(X))$?

Since we have $\mathrm{Bl}_I(X) = \mathrm{Proj}_X \oplus_{n \geq 0} I^n$  one can ask more generally what functor $\mathrm{Proj}_X \mathcal{A}$ represents when $\mathcal{A}$ is a sufficiently nice graded $\mathcal{O}_X$-algebra. This is indicated in EGA II 3.7 but the condition that the partial morphism $r_{\mathcal{L}\psi}$ is defined everywhere is only made explicit for affine $X$ in loc. cit. Cor. 3.7.4. If $\mathcal{A}=\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal{E})$ for some vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ then the condition is just that $\psi$ (defined in loc. cit. 3.7.1) is surjective so that the universal property of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$ is very similar to the one of the usual projective space. But $\oplus_{n \geq 0} I^n$ obviously does not have this form unless $I$ is flat or something like that.

In any case there seems to be an injective map from

$$\{(f\mathcal{L}\psi) : f \in \hom(YX)  \mathcal{L} \text{ line bundle on } Y \psi : f^*(\mathcal{A})  \twoheadrightarrow \oplus_n \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}\}$$

to $\hom(Y\mathrm{Proj} \mathcal{A})$. EDIT: In Jason Starr's answer it is claimed that this is a bijection. Can someone give a reference in the literature for this observation?

""Let $X \to S$ be the blowing up of $S$ in some center $Y \subseteq S$. Try to the understand the point functor $h_{X/S}$. Then explain why it is hard to understand blow-ups.""

91359,"In the theory of the Riemann zeta function Montgomery's Pair correlation function is defined as

$$
F(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N(T)} 
\sum_{T &lt; \gamma \gamma' &lt; 2T} T^{i \alpha (\gamma - \gamma')} \cdot \frac{4}{4+(\gamma - \gamma')}
$$

where $N(T)$ is the total number of zeroes of the $\zeta$ function at height between $T$ and $2T$ and $\gamma \gamma'$ are ordinates of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.

As $T \rightarrow \infty$ the dependance on $T$ vanishes and for this reason by abuse of notation we think of $F$ as just a function of $\alpha$. In effect $F(\alpha)$ is the Fourier transform of the function that measures how often two distinct zeroes of the Riemann zeta function come together. 

Montgomery proved that $F(\alpha) = \alpha$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and conjectured that $F(\alpha)=1$ for $\alpha > 1$. He also proved that $F(\alpha)$ is positive and symmetric around $0$. However implicit in all this work is the assumption that the Riemann Hypothesis holds.

My question is the following: Is it possible to formulate an ""unconditional"" analogue of Montgomery's pair correlation function for example either by 1) allowing some additional large terms in the sum corresponding to possible zeroes off the line or 2) by taking into account only the $40$ percent or so of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function that we know to lie on the critical line?

Suppose now you want to construct a representation of $G$ on a category $\mathcal{C}$ (the type of representations studied in the appendix of [1] or in chapter 7 of [2]). Then you may consider a $G$-equivariant gerbe $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$ and again take global sections. 

In the former case you find out that essentially all (finite dimensional over $\mathbb{C}$ etc) representations of $G$ arise in a geometric way: there exists a manifold $X$ (ie. the flag variety $G/B$ for a choice of a Borel $B \subset G$) and an equivalence of tensor categories between certain $D_X$-modules and $G$-rep. This is known as Beilinson-Bernstein localization and I'll refer to [3] for the precise statements.

$$x_1^k+x_2^k+\cdots+x_n^k=y^k.$$

Walter observed that an upper bound for $n(k)$ is $G(k)$ [EDIT: this should probably say $G(k)+1$] the ""big $G$"" function used as standard notation in discussions of Waring's Problem. Explicitly $G(k)$ is the smallest $m$ such that every sufficiently large integer is the sum of at most $m$ $k$th powers; the trick of course is then to choose a sufficiently large $k$th power [EDIT: and then subtract 1.]. Hence $n(k)$ grows at most as fast as $G(k)$ and a fair bit is known about the growth of $G(k)$ (again see the Wikipedia page); for example $G(k)=O(k\log(k))$. We deduce that $n(k)$ is at most $O(k\log(k))$. The question is whether it is possible to do any better.

I would imagine that lower bounds are hopeless -- it was a lot of work to prove that $n(k)\geq3$ for all $k\geq3$ and I am not sure that mathematics is ready to rule out the possibility that there are arbitrarily large integers $k$ such that there are solutions to $a^k+b^k+c^k=d^k$ in positive integers (i.e. that $n(k)\geq4$ for all sufficiently large $k$). But it did not seem unreasonable to hope that there were better upper bounds than the naive approach going via $G(k)$ so I told him I'd ask here.

91383,"Background

Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic 0. Let $B \subseteq G$ be a Borel subgroup and let $U \subseteq B$ be its unipotent radical. Let $\mathfrak g$ $\mathfrak b$ and $\mathfrak n$ be the corresponding Lie algebras. Also let $\mathcal T^*$ denote the cotangent bundle of the flag variety $G/B$; then $\mathcal T^*$ is isomorphic to the homogeneous bundle $G \times^B \mathfrak n$.

For any representation $M$ of $B$ let $\mathcal L(M)$ denote the homogeneous line bundle on $G/B$ with fiber $M$ and let $\mathcal L'(M)$ denote the pullback of this bundle to $\mathcal T^*$. In particular for any weight $\lambda$ of $G$ we have the bundles $\mathcal L(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal L'(\lambda)$. Let $H^0(\lambda)$ denote the global sections of $\mathcal L(\lambda)$.

By the projection formula we have $$  H^0( \mathcal T^* \mathcal L'(M) ) \cong H^0 \big( G/B \mathcal L( k[\mathfrak n] ) \otimes \mathcal L(M) \big) . $$ In particular since $k[\mathfrak n]$ is a graded $B$-module $H^0( \mathcal T^* \mathcal L'(M) )$ naturally has the structure of a graded $G$-module.

Question

Let $\lambda$ be a weight of $G$. The natural $B$-equivariant surjection $k[\mathfrak g] \twoheadrightarrow k[\mathfrak n]$ corresponding to the inclusion $\mathfrak n \hookrightarrow \mathfrak g$ induces a sheaf surjection $\mathcal L(k[\mathfrak g]) \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal L(k[\mathfrak n])$ and hence twisting by $\lambda$ and taking global sections we obtain a $G$-equivariant gradation-preserving morphism $$  k[\mathfrak g] \otimes H^0(\lambda) \cong H^0( G/B \mathcal L(k[\mathfrak g]) \otimes \mathcal L(\lambda) ) \to H^0( G/B \mathcal L(k[\mathfrak n]) \otimes \mathcal L(\lambda) ) \cong H^0( \mathcal T^* \mathcal L'(\lambda) ) . $$ In his paper ""Line Bundles On The Cotangent Bundle Of The Flag Variety"" Broer proves that this morphism is surjective when $\lambda$ is dominant. He also remarks that there is an alternate proof of this fact using the following standard fact from algebraic geometry: If $i : X \to \mathbb P^n_A$ is a morphism of $A$-schemes then $i^*( \mathcal O(1) )$ is an invertible sheaf on $X$ which is globally generated by the pullback of the global sections of $\mathcal O(1)$.

My question is: what is this alternate proof? It's mysterious to me where this remark comes from. I assume that one should use the inclusion $$  G \times^B \mathfrak n \hookrightarrow G \times^B \mathfrak g \cong G/B \times \mathfrak g $$ but I can't seem to figure the rest out. (My motivation is that I'd like to give a proof of this fact when $k$ is a field of arbitrary characteristic).

Since the Laplace transform is analytic in its DOC knowledge of $f(\lambda$) on a line segment uniquely determines $f(\lambda)$ on its domain.

As most of you already know in model checking most linear-time properties are either safety properties or liveness properties. A linear time property is usually described with an omega-regular language that tells exactly which traces satisfy the property.

To check if a property is actually a safety property one method would be to calculate the closure of the property and check whether its closure (as a set of infinite words) and the property itself (also as a set of infinite words) are equal. To calculate the closure it is important to calculate the set on finite prefixes of the omega-regular language that describes the property.

I have a problem relating to primitive prime divisors. (For a sequence $(A_n)_{n\ge1}$ a primitive prime divisor of a term $A_n$ is a prime $\ell$ that divides $A_n$ but does not divide $A_i$ for all $i&lt;n$.)

Assume that $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes and $n\geq 3$ a fixed positive integer so that $p^n-1$ and $q^n-1$ have at least one primitive prime divisor (by the Bang-Zsigmondy theorem). 


Question 1: When do $p^n-1$ and $q^n-1$ have a common primitive prime divisor?
Question 2: When do $p^n-1$ and $p^n-q^n$ have a common primitive prime divisor (which will be a divisor although not necessarily primitive of $q^n-1$)?


If you have some source please tell me.

Thanks a lot in advance.

This is a follow up to a previous question here in MO but I will make this question self-contained for convenience. Those already familiar with the following paper [G] by Gross can safely skip down to the questions below.

In [G] 


Benedict H. Gross ""A tameness criterion for Galois representations associated to modular forms (mod $p$)"" Duke Math. Journal Vol. 61 No. 2 1990 


Gross shows criteria (A) and (B) below. Let $p$ be a prime and let $f=\sum a_nq^n$ be a normalized cuspidal eigenform of weight $k$ and character $\varepsilon$ for $\Gamma_1(N)$ with coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$. Let $$\rho_f:\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})\to \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F})$$
be a continuous semi-simple Galois representation such that $\rho_f$ is unramified for all primes $\ell$ such that $\gcd(\ellNp)=1$ and the matrix $\rho_f(Frob_\ell)$ has characteristic polynomial $x^2-a_\ell x+\varepsilon(\ell)\ell^{k-1}$.

Assume $2\leq k\leq p$ and $a_p\neq 0$ (if $k=p$ assume $a_p^2\neq \varepsilon(p)$. The criterion says as follows: 


(A) The representation $\rho_f$ is completely reducible when restricted to a decomposition group at $p$ if and only if there is a companion form for $f$ i.e. there is $g=\sum b_nq^n$ of weight $k'=p+1-k$ and character $\varepsilon$ for $\Gamma_1(N)$ over $\mathbb{F}$ such that $n^kb_n=na_n$ for all $n\geq 1$.


The statements with all the details are in [G] Proposition 13.8 and Theorem 13.10. 

Now jump to p. 514 of [G]. Suppose that $f$ is the reduction mod $p$ of a newform $F$ of weight $2$ where $F$ has trivial character on $\Gamma_1(N)$ and has coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. Then $F$ corresponds to an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ of conductor $N$. Let $$\rho_{Ep} : \operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)$$ 
be the representation associated to the action of Galois on the Tate module $T_p(E)$. Let   us denote $\rho_{Ep} \bmod p$ by ${\overline{\rho}}$. Then Gross deduces the following criterion when $E$ has good ordinary reduction at $p$ with $j(E)\neq 0 1728$ and $\overline{\rho}$ is irreducible:


(B) The restriction of $\rho_{Ep} \bmod p^n$ to a decomposition group at $p$ is diagonalizable if and only if $j(E)\equiv j_0 \bmod 2p^{n+1}$ where $j_0$ is the $j$-invariant of the ""canonical lifting"" to $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $E \bmod p$.


Now my questions:


Question 1: I take it that Gross assumes that $\overline{\rho}$ be irreducible in (B) so it coincides with its semi-simplification and therefore $\overline{\rho}$ is equivalent to $\rho_f$ and (A) applies. But does criterion (B) still hold if $\overline{\rho}$ is reducible? I.e. what if $E$ has a $\mathbb{Q}$-rational $p$-isogeny? For an example see my previous question here in MO where I specify my interest in the curve $E$ with Cremona label 1225h1 which has a rational $37$-isogeny.
Question 2: If (B) does not hold when $\overline{\rho}$ is reducible (or if it is not known whether it holds) do any of the two directions of the if-and-only-if hold when $\overline{\rho}$ is reducible?
Question 3: If $E/\mathbb{Q}$ has potential good ordinary reduction does (B) still hold?

The 2D-case has a solution this is due to Chebyshev and it is more than 100 years old.
In general 3D Chebyshev net is a solution of 3 equasions as above where $f$ maps a domain in $\mathbb R^3$ in a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold and $|{*}|$ is defined by its metric. I guess this case is just as hard as the special case described above.
Assuming that $x+y+z>0$ and $f(xyz)$ is defined
it is easy to see that $f(xyz)$ depends only on the values
$f(x'y'z')$ for $(x'y'z')$ in the triangle $\Delta\subset\mathbb W^2$ defined by the inequalities $$x'\le x\  y'\le y\ z'\le z.$$

$$\int_a^b u^2(xt)dx\leq e^{-\frac{2\pi^2}{(b-a)^2}t} \int_a^b u_0^2(x)dx$$

I'm trying to reinvent the wheel here by deriving the formula for Dyck Words of length p+q that is p left parens and q right parens.  The answer of course is $\binom{p+q}{q} - \binom{p+q}{q-1}$.

Using an OGF if I'm right starting from the recurrence $c_{pq} = c_{p-1q} + c_{pq-1} \quad q \leq p$ and letting $c(xy) = \sum_{p=0} \sum_{q\leq p}c_{pq}x^p y^q$ I should get $c(xy)-1 = x \times c(xy) + y \times f(xy)$.

It is this $f(xy)$ that is troubling me.  Reverse engineering the answer it seems to me that I need $c(xy)(1-x-y)=1-y/x$ which would have come from $c(xy)-1 = x \times c(xy) + y \times (c(xy)-1/x)$.  I don't see how this could be.

  Is it then true that $a_1\neq 0$?


If this is true is $|a_1|$ bounded away from zero as $f$ varies? It may be that some other normalization might make the second question more tractable: for example instead of normalizing the length to be $2\pi$ by a change of scale as I have done above one could require that a disk of unit radius be contained in the disk bounded by $f$. Any such normalization of $f$ would be highly acceptable.

There are at least two reasonable norms defined on this space.  The first is the HÃ¶lder norm which is just the supremum above.  Another is the $1/\alpha$-variation which is the supremum over all partitions $t_0 = 0 \le t_1 \le \cdots \le t_r = 1$ of $\left(\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}|f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i)|^{1/\alpha}\right)^\alpha$.

Let us fix $\alpha= \frac{1}{2}$ and $x(t) = \sqrt{t}$ and suppose $y:[01] \to \mathbb{R}$ is piecewise linear with $y(0) = 0$.  It follows easily that $\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{\|x(t)-y(t)\|}{\sqrt{t}} = 1$.

This implies that there is no sequence of piecewise linear approximations to $x$ in HÃ¶lder norm.

91490,"This question deals with 2D random walks on continuous space (not lattices). A continuous-time persistent random walk is one where the particle 'remembers' its velocity $v(t)$ for a short period of time. More rigorously in a persistent random walk we have:

$&lt;v(t+\tau).v(t)&gt; = S^2e^{-\tau/P}$

Where the $&lt;.>$ denotes expected value which is taken over all $t$ (and we assume that $t$ ranges from 0 to infinity) and $\tau\ge0$. $S$ is the root-mean-squared speed of the particle and $P$ is called the persistence time.

Among other things in continuous-time persistent random walks we have the property that the turning angle at each point in time is normally-distributed with variance $2/P$.

I'm considering an ensemble of particles all released at time 0 from the origin in random directions with uniform density in every direction. The question I ask is: what is the probability density function of finding a particle at distance $r$ from the origin after time $t$? For non-persistent random walks or if $t >> P$ the answer is well-known: it is simply the solution to the diffusion equation. Also if just the mean distance of all particles after time $t$ is required that is also well known; the mean-squared distance is $2S^2P[t - P(1 - e^{-t/P})]$. However I haven't been able to find the distribution of distances for persistent random walks.

I suspect that the answer depends upon the speed $|v(t)|$ of the particles. However for the simple case where $|v(t)|=S$ for all $t$ I haven't been able to find the answer either. Any help would be appreciated.

91513,"Consider the orthogonal group $G=O(n)$ as a subset of the vector space of $n\times n$ real matrices. Let $C=C(G)$ denote the Euclidean cone over  $G$ i.e. the space of matrices of the form $tA A\in G t\in {\mathbb R}$. 

Question. What are vector subspaces in $C$? For instance are there 3-dimensional linear subspaces? (One can ask the same question for cones over other linear Lie groups $G$.) 

Update: Dmitri noticed that in dimensions divisible by $4$ and $8$ there are 4-dimensional and 8-dimensional linear subspaces coming from quaternions and octonions. Thus the question is: What are other linear subspaces in particular are there linear subspaces (which are not lines) for odd $n$? Are there linear subspaces which are not contained in cones over subgroups? 

Trivial examples of subspaces in $C(G)$ are planes obtained as cones over $O(2)$.

This proof is not rigorous. In any set theory I can think of a finite set is equinumerous to ${0 \dots n}$ where $n$ may be a non-standard integer. So when we are proving things about finite sets we really should allow the size of the set to be non-standard. But at least implicitly any proof assumes that $n$ is a standard integer.

This seems to be different than proofs of arithmetic in which we can assume that the computations are occurring in the true structure of $\mathbf N$ which contains only standard integers. We may need extra axioms to pin down the behavior of $\mathbf N$ but we ultimately will never need the non-standard integers.

EDIT: I think I have boiled down this issue to the the following example.

We will prove that $CON(ZFC) \vdash (ZFC \vdash CON(ZFC))$ which is obviously false.

Consider the following proof. Suppose CON(ZFC) is true. Given a model $M$ of ZFC and $n$ an integer of $M$. If $n$ is a standard integer then by assumption $n$ is not a proof of contradiction of ZFC. So we have shown that for all standard integers $n$ and all models $M$ of ZFC $n \in M$ does not disprove ZFC. Hence by the transfer principle ZFC proves that all integers $n$ are not disproofs of ZFC. Hence ZFC proves CON(ZFC).

The key issue is that some formulas do behave differently for standard and non-standard formulas. In this case the formula ""$x$ is a disproof of ZFC"" is a formula which picks out the non-standard integers.

If we take for example the ($N$-independent) Gaussian case $\mu_N=e^{-x^2/2}$ where is known that $$a_{kN}=\sqrt{k}\qquad b_{kN}=0$$ 

it then follows by change of variable that for its renormalized version $\mu_N=e^{-Nx^2/2}$ we have $$a_{kN}=\sqrt{k/N} \qquad b_{kN}=0.$$
Thus there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that  as $N\rightarrow\infty$

91563,"There are a number of model categories important in higher category theory which provide a ""presentation"" of some $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories. For example:


The Joyal model structure on simplicial sets which presents the $\infty $ (i.e. $(\infty 1)$)-category of quasi-categories (the fibrant objects are the quasi-categories the weak equivalences are the categorical equivalences and the cofibrations are the injections).
The covariant (or dually contravariant) model structure on simplicial sets over a base simplicial set $S$. This presents the $\infty$-category of quasicategories ""cofibered in groupoids"" over $S$ where ""groupoids"" really means Kan complexes and ""cofibered"" means ""left fibration."" The fibrant objects are the left fibrations over $S$.
The coCartesian (or dually Cartesian) model structure on marked simplicial sets over a base simplicial set $S$; this presents the $\infty$-category of quasicategories ""cofibered"" over $S$ (in quasicategories not necessarily in Kan complexes). The fibrant objects are precisely the coCartesian fibrations to $S$ with the coCartesian edges (and no others) marked.


All these model structures are efficiently constructed in HTT  using a general machine which starts with generating cofibrations and weak equivalences and builds a cofibrantly generated (even combinatorial) model structure essentially by using a cardinality argument to produce the generating acyclic cofibrations (i.e. take all acyclic cofibrations between objects of bounded cardinality) and the small object argument to get the factorizations. Unfortunately this machine doesn't provide much of a handle on what the generating acyclic cofibrations actually are or equivalently what the fibrations look like.

I'm curious if an explicit description of the generating acyclic cofibrations in any of these cases is known. (According to the nLab this is or at least was an open problem in the first case.) What I do know is that in all three of the above situations there is a very concrete and easily describable class of ""anodyne"" maps such that the fibrant objects are precisely those with the right lifting property with respect to these and such that the fibrations between fibrant objects can be so described as well. (In case 1 the inner anodyne maps together with the inclusion $\ast \to N(J)$ for $J$ a contractible groupoid on two objects works; in case 2 the left anodyne maps in case 3 the marked anodyne maps -- actually the opposite of the maps Lurie calls by that name.)

It'd be very nice if these were in fact generating acyclic cofibrations. At least in cases 2 and 3 that doesn't seem to be true because the model structures are simplicial: given any object $X$ (over $S$) the map $\Delta^0 \times X \to \Delta^1 \times X$ is a  trivial cofibration and if the inclusion $\Delta^0 \to \Delta^1$ is the inclusion of the second vertex we don't have an anodyne map in this case. On the other hand I don't see any obvious reason why taking the previous ""anodyne"" maps together with all $A \times X \to B \times X$ for $A \to B$ a trivial cofibration of simplicial sets wouldn't be sufficient. Are they in fact sufficient?

91569,"I'm interested in a complexity question related to problems like the slice-ribbon problem. 

To be specific if $K \subset S^3$ is a knot it might be non-trivial yet still bound a smoothly-embedded compact 2-dimensional ball $B \subset D^4$ where we consider $S^3 = \partial D^4$ and the ball is required to be properly embedded meaning $B \cap D^4 = \partial B = K$.  This is called a (smoothly) slice knot. 

The slice-ribbon conjecture states that the only way this can happen is if you can find $B$ so that the distance function $d : D^4 \to \mathbb R$ given by $d(x) = |x|$ has no local maxima on $B$ i.e. it is Morse with only saddle points and local minima on $B$ and no other critical points. 


Q1: Do people have computations describing how many such saddle points you need for knots?  In a ribbon diagram for the knot this is the number of components in the self-intersection set.  I'm particularly interested in how this number would relate to a minimal-complexity planar knot diagram for the knot -- where you minimize crossing number or some other similar feature of a knot diagram.  I want this complexity to be related to the number of tetrahedra you would need in a triangulation of $S^3$ so that the knot is a ""normal curve"" in the triangulation meaning transverse to the triangulation and linear inside each tetrahedron. 


More generally I'm interested in the computational problem of finding candidate knots that are smoothly slice yet not ribbon.  In 3-manifold theory there is a ""normalization"" process for normal surfaces in a triangulated manifold.  This involves some isotopy and embedded surgery.   There is a much more primitive type of ""normalization"" process that works in any triangulated manifold (of any dimension) with respect to any submanifold -- simply subdivide the ambient triangulation and perturb the submanifold to be transverse.  After some number of subdivisions the submanifold will have to appear to be linear in each top-dimensional simplex.  This is the key idea in Whitehead's proof that smooth manifolds admit triangulations.


Q2: Are there any good estimates for how many subdivisions it takes to ""normalize"" a submanifold in the above Whitehead sense?   


Q2 can be taken to be quite general. For example for curves in surfaces you can always normalize without any subdividing at all all it takes is an isotopy.  After minimizing the number of intersection points with the 1-skeleton of the triangulation the only curve that needs more than a small isotopy (in the sense of the mapping space topology) would be the boundary of a disc embedded in the interior of a triangle. 

For example is there an interesting topological invariant of a knot that gives good lower-bounds on the number of tetrahedra you need to triangulate $S^3$ to make it appear to be locally linear?   Things like the maximum of the curvature aren't topological and I consider crossing number in a planar diagram to be not computationally-friendly enough.

Many other famous group theorists also confirmed that these notes are important to their work. Since the notes do not be published I can not find way to see them. But I am very curious about what's in these notes? Are there any theory about groups we don't know or do not appear in published books or papers?

  There exists $\rho>0$ such that for every $x \in \Omega$ there is a ball $B_\rho$ of radius $\rho$ such that $x \in B_\rho \subset \Omega$. This rhoughly means that the curvature of the domain is bounded from above.

Condition set 1

(2) $P(D_1D_2...D_m|H_i)=\prod_jP(D_j|H_i)$ $1\leq i\leq n$

(3) $P(D_1D_2...D_m|\overline{H_i})=\prod_jP(D_j|\overline{H_i})$ $1\leq i\leq n$

where $\overline{H_i}$ means the negation of $H_i$.

(2) $P(D_rD_s|H_i)=P(D_r|H_i)P(D_s|H_i)$ for any $r\neq s$ $1\leq i\leq n$

(3) $P(D_rD_s|\overline{H_i})=P(D_r|\bar{H_i})P(D_s|\bar{H_i})$ for any $r\neq s$ $1\leq i\leq n$

Claim: If $n>2$ then at most one of the following fractions 

$\frac{P(D_1|H_i)}{P(D_1|\overline{H_i})}\frac{P(D_2|H_i)}{P(D_2|\overline{H_i})}...\frac{P(D_m|H_i)}{P(D_m|\overline{H_i})}$ can differ from unity $1\leq i\leq n$.

The question: Is the 1st set of conditions sufficient to establishing the claim or only the 2nd set of stronger conditions is sufficient? Either way how can we prove it? Is there an intuitive explanation why the claim has to be true giving those conditions? 



To understand the background and motivation for this problem think of ${H_1...H_n}$ as a set of exhuastive and mutually independent (which means (1) applies) candidate hypotheses we want to test by some experiment that generates data ${D_1...D_m}$. 

Define $O(H_i|D_1D_2...D_m)\equiv \frac{P(H_i|D_1D_2...D_m)}{P(\bar{H_i}|D_1D_2...D_m)}$ as the Odds that $H_i$ is true v.s false giving data $D_1$ to $D_m$. 

By this definition $O(H_i|D_1D_2...D_m)=O(H_i)\frac{P(D_1D_2...D_m|H_i)}{P(D_1D_2...D_m|\bar{H_i})}$.

Now in such tests it is common that you can design your experiment so that the data $D_i$ are mutually independent giving $H_i$. So (2) is true.

If the claim is true and you have more than two hypotheses to test the experiment will serve its purpose only if (3) is false. To see why suppose instead (3) holds so the data are also independent giving the negation of $H_i$. Then we have

$O(H_i|D_1D_2...D_m)=O(H_i) \prod_j\frac{P(D_j|H_i)}{P(D_j|\bar{H_i})}$    (*)

But by the claim only at most one of the fractions in the production can differ from $1$ which means at most one datum can be useful for improving upon the prior odds of a hypothesis ($O(H_i)$). 

The lesson is that giving (1) and (2) even if $D_i$'s are physically or causally independent (3) remains a strong ad hoc assumption that either reduces the information of additional data to triviality (if true) or calculates incorrect result by (*) (if false).

91619,"It is well known that if $M$ is a smooth $(n-1)$-dimensional surface in $\mathbb R^n$ (e.g. a subspace) then there is a continuous trace operator $W^{sp}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/pp}(M)$. Now suppose that $M$ is a manifold with boundary e.g. $M={0}\times\mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R^{n-2}\subset\mathbb R^n$ and in this case call the boundary $\Sigma:=\partial M={(00)}\times\mathbb R^{n-2}$. 

The question (it's more a poll) is how to define the trace on $\Sigma$ (and I'd expect a function $W^{sp}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-2/pp}(\Sigma)$) in such a way that the composed trace $$W^{sp}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/pp}(M)\to W^{s-2/pp}(\Sigma)$$ 
is independent of the (smooth) manifold $M$. 

Another (i.e. the more challenging) question is if you can (or prove it impossible to) find an example of two different compositions of linear continuous functionals as above (with two $M M'$ smooth and with boundaries both equal to $\Sigma$ which by locality we suppose here to be orthogonal half-hyperplanes) without the requirement that the first functions $W^{sp}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/pp}(M\:or\:M')$ be the usual traces but such that then composed with the traces within $M M'$ they give the codimension $2$ trace on $\Sigma$ of the first question.

The question is inspired from a small book by Tartar (""An intorduction to Sobolev spaces and  interpolation spaces"" chapter 40) where (codimension one) trace spaces are identified with interpolation spaces baiscally by parametrizing the ""killed"" spatial coordinate in $\mathbb R^n$ with the interpolation parameter. In the light of that construction it would appear that the reason why the first question should have a positive answer is because partial derivatives of linear functions commute: if no example could be done for the second question it would (to me) indicate strongly that linearity is a die-hard property so to speak.

91633,"Is there a well defined subset of the integers that cannot be defined as a property of a recursive process or Turing Machine?

I have long been intrigued by the observation that much of mathematics can be defined as properties of recursive processes or Turing Machines. One can construct the arithmetic hierarchy by all finite iterations of the question: does a TM have an infinite number of outputs such that an infinite subset of these outputs are GÃ¶del numbers of TMs with an an infinite number of outputs? One can construct the hyperarithmetic hierarchy by iterating this question up to all recursive ordinals. One can go farther by asking does a TM which accepts an arbitrarily long sequence of integer inputs halt for every possible infinite sequence?

These are all questions that are in some sense logically determined by a recursively enumerable sequence of events: all the possible paths a TM can take with any possible finite sequence of inputs. Can one define a subset of the integers that cannot be defined in this way? Saying that a set is the even integers if the continuum hypothesis is true and the odd integers otherwise does not count since both alternatives are definable as properties of a TM. On the other hand giving a recursively enumerable sequence of statements whose truth values cannot be encoded as a property of recursive processes would count.

Of course the notion of property of a TM is indefinitely expandable. but it must be limited to a process that depends only on a recursively enumerable sequence of events.

It is known that $S$ is denumerable and closed (Salem). Alors the sequence of derived sets $S'S'' ...$ does not terminate. The smallest accumulation point of $S$ is the golden ratio $\phi$.


  Let $\lambda$ be an accumulation point in $S$. Therefore it is the limit of a sequence of Pisot numbers $\mu_n\ne\lambda$. It is clear that the degree of $\mu_n$ tends to $+\infty$ whereas its norm remains bounded as $n\rightarrow+\infty$. My question is about the Galois conjugates of $\mu_n$; most of them must be close to the unit circle because their product equals $N(\mu_n)/\mu_n$. Given a Galois conjugate $\tau$ of $\lambda$ does there exist a Galois conjugate $\tau_n$ of $\mu_n$ such that $\tau_n\rightarrow\tau$ ? What is the statistics of the Galois conjugates of $\mu_n$ as $n\rightarrow+\infty$ ?


Example: the multinacci number of degree $d$ is the root $a_d>1$ of the polynomial $X^d-X^{d-1}-\cdots-X-1$. When $d\rightarrow+\infty$ one has $a_d\rightarrow2$. Then I have a proof that the empirical measure
$$m_d:=\frac1d\sum_{a\sim a_d}\delta_a$$
where the sum runs over all the Galois conjugates of $a_d$ (including itself) converges vaguely towards the uniform measure over the unit circle.

Edit. The same property holds true in the situation depicted by Dufresnoy and Pisot. Let $P\in{\mathbb Z}[X]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\lambda$ unitary. Let $A\in{\mathbb Z}[X]$ be such that $|A(z)|\le|P(z)|$ on $\mathbb T$ the equality arising only at finitely many points. Define the polynomials $P_n^\pm(X)=X^nP(X)\mp A(X)$. For infinitely many pairs $(n\pm)$ $P_n^\pm$ has only one root $\lambda_n^\pm$ away from the unit disk and none over $\mathbb T$. This Pisot number tends to $\lambda$ and the empirical measure defined as above tends to $\frac1{2\pi}d\theta$. It is thus tempting to conjecture that in every situation the empirical measure  tends to the uniform measure.

that is - between variables $a_k$ and $a_{(k+1)}$ You put two of ""1"" in the firs and one ""1"" in the second term... You may consider this as generalisation of Fibonacci recurrence - because if You put all $a_i =1$ You obtain Fibonacci numbers. 

For example:

$K(a_0a_111a_2) = (2 a_0 a_1+ a_0+2)a_2+a_0 a_1+a_0+1$

where M is continuant matrix 2x2 and $STL$ and $I$ (unity matrix) are constant matrices which form base in $SL(2Z)$ space - they are defined in Sage workbook accesible for download here: http://fiksacie.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/ulamki-lancuchowe-nonstandard-matrix-representation-of-continued-fractions-cz-5/ There is also several essays about that on my blog - in polish. Proof is simple linear algebra exercise: 

start from monoid formed by $ST$ generators ( which represent in nonstandard way moves on Stern-Brocot tree - standard way consists of R-ight and L-eft RL matrices) and then construct ring over rationals with $ISTL$ generators and then formula above appears. M is defined as follows ( it is continuant matrix representation for given continued fraction $x = [a_{0}a_{1}a_{2}...a_{n}]$ )

(2) $ M = S \prod_{i=0}^{n} S(ST)^{a_{i}}$. 

$S$ is that $S^2 =I$ and $T$ is that $T^2 = I+T$ so 

$I = T^2 -T = S(ST)S(ST) - S(ST)$ 

Then You may insert it in any place between $S(ST)^{a_{i}}S(ST)^{a_{i+1}}$  which gives expression above and many more if You consider $T^p$ for $p \in Z$ etc. 



It is worth to note that in the general ring $Q[{ISTL}]$ matrix $M$ has decomposition in the form $M=aI+bS+cT+dL$ with rational $abcd$ and that continued fractions form algebraic curve which equations is given by bilinear form $\left| w^TBw \right| = 1$ where $w=[abcd]$ - column vector where $abcd$ are integers (there are additional inequalities for this coefficients - because $M$ has to have positive elements)

Please note that (1) and (2) allows similarity transformations and then You may choose any base in SL(2Z) space and that whole construction may be easily generalized to bigger than 2x2 dimensional matrices. I have many questions here to ask some of which are:

(A) are there irreducible representations of this construction in SL(DZ) spaces where D>2?

(B) are there representations in complex number set ${z_1...z_4}$ which obeys the same multiplication table as for $ISTL$ matrices? How to express (1) in that case?

91649,"I have been wondering about something for a while now and the simplest incarnation of it is the following question:


  Find a finite group that is not a subgroup of any $GL_2(q)$.


Here $GL_2(q)$ is the group of nonsingular $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Maybe I am fooled by the context in which this arose but it seems quite unlikely that ""many"" finite groups are subgroups of $GL_2(q)$. Still I can't seem to exclude a single group but I am likely being stupid. 

Motivation: This arose when I tried to do some explicit calculations related to Serre's modularity conjecture. I wanted to get my hands on some concrete Galois representations and play around with the newforms associated to it. Call it recreational if you like (it certainly is!). In Serre's original paper [1] there is a wonderful treatment of some explicit examples. He uses the observation that the Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of

$$x^7 -7x +3$$

is isomorphic to $PSL_2(7)$. This gives him a surjection $G_{\mathbb{Q}} := \mbox{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow PSL_2(7)$ which he combines with the character associated to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ to obtain a homomorphism $G_{\mathbb{Q}} \rightarrow PSL_2(7) \times C_2$. This homomorphism he can then lift to $GL_2(49)$ using a very clever calculation in the Brauer group. 

The way I see it (without claiming this is justified) is that it is unclear or even provably impossible to embed $PSL_2(7)$ directly into some $GL_2(q)$ and for that reason we need a nice lifting.

This raises the natural question of when this little trick with the Brauer group is ""necessary"". What can be said in general about subgroups of $GL_2(q)$? Can we exclude any particular finite group or families of finite groups? Can we perhaps even classify the possible isomorphism types of such subgroups? Of course this is all becomes even more natural to ask in the light of the inverse Galois problem. How many Galois groups can we ""see"" in the two-dimensional representations?

Remark. Of course the question could be approached the other way. If one has the (perhaps not unrealistic?) hope of realising every $GL_2(q)$ as a Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}$ how many groups do you automatically realise over $\mathbb{Q}$ by taking quotients of $GL_2(q)$?


  Which groups $G$ admit a surjection $GL_2(q) \rightarrow G \rightarrow 1$ for some $q$?

91650,"I am trying to emerge from my complete ignorance about intersection theory.
I have a bias toward sheaves so I like the idea of doing intersection theory with the K-group of coherent sheaves. From what I understand the graded (by codimension) K-group GK is isomorphic to the Chow group A after tensoring with the rational numbers (and I probably need to say smooth variety).

I know of two/three places where to learn this stuff: Fulton Lang RR algebra; the book chapter by Henri Gillet titled k-theory and intersection theroy; the set of lecture notes by Pedro Sancho de Salas http://matematicas.unex.es/~sancho/ (the link is for his webpage which contains a few goodies).

However the numerical group (the quotient of A modulo numerical equivalence) doesn't seem to be mentioned. The codimension one group is usually called the Neron-Severi group and is mentioned in some books the whole group is briefly (if i recall correctly) mentioned in Fultonn's book on intersection theory.

Are there any good references for the numerical group treated from the point of view of the K-group?

Is it true that GN (the graded K-group of coherent sheaves modulo numerical equivalence) is isomorphic to N the Chow group modulo numerical equivalence) without having to tensor by the rationals?

p.s. I say two elements of K are numerically equivalent if they $\chi(-F)$ gives the same answer for any sheaf F.

91657,"Shalom [edit: originally M. Burger] showed that the pair $(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \ltimes \mathbb{Z}^2 \mathbb{Z}^2)$ has Relative Property (T) with respect to standard generating sets.

(The action of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is the usual one i.e. the semidirect product can be thought of as a group of affine transformations $x \mapsto A x + b$ where $A \in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and $b \in \mathbb{Z}^2$.

If we reduce $\mathrm{mod}\ p$ we can think of this as giving an ""efficient"" way of generating the translations $x \mapsto x + b$ for $b \in F_p^2$.)

A one-dimensional variant in the finite case is whether there exist bounded size subsets $S_p \subset F_p^{\times} \ltimes F_p$ and $\delta > 0$ such that the relative Kazhdan constant:

$\kappa\ (F_p^{\times} \ltimes F_p F_p S_p) \ge \delta$

i.e. whether the pairs $(F_p^{\times} \ltimes F_p F_p)$ can form a relative expander family.

An equivalent formulation: do there exist bounded size sets $S_p$ of affine transformations on $F_p$ such that no non-empty subset $U \subset F_p$ $|U| \leq p/2$ is almost invariant with respect to all of them i.e.

$\neg \exists U: \forall s \in S: |s(U) \cap U| > \frac{99}{100} |U|$

I believe the answer is no if one uses standard ""generating"" sets (they needn't actually generate) such as $x \mapsto x + 1\ x \mapsto ax$ even if $a$ is allowed to vary with $p$.  This is very slightly surprising as these do generate all translations ""efficiently"" in the weaker sense of logarithmic diameter.

Is there a good argument as to why this should fail in general?  Or might there be cunning sets $S_p$ such that relative expansion occurs?

I introduced 81 variables $x_1$ to $x_{81}$ this is a linearisation of the sudoku board.

The space of valid sudokus is defined by:

for $i=1\ldots81$ : $F_i = (x_i - 1)(x_i - 2)\cdots(x_i - 9)$
    This represents the fact that all squares have integer values between 1 and 9.

for all $x_i$ and $x_j$ which are not equal but in the same row column or block:
    $G_{ij} = (F_i - F_j)/(x_i - x_j)$
    This represents that the variables $x_i$ and $x_j$ can not be equal.

All these $F_i$ and $G_{ij}$ together define the space of valid sudokus. This conists of 891 polynomials. 

Now to solve a sudoku we can add the clues to the space so by example if the clue of a sudoku is the first square is a 5 then we add $(x_1 - 5)$ to the space.
If we now take the groebner basis of this space we can directly see the solution for it.

91672,"For the Dedekind eta function defined as usual by $\eta(q) = q^{\frac1{24}} \prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^{n}) $ let for brevity $e_k:=\eta(q^k)$. With this notation a blog entry of Michael Somos gives three beautiful identities for sums of $\eta$-products where all exponents are only $0$ or $1$:

$I_{60}:\qquad \ \ e_{1}e_{12}e_{15}e_{20} + e_{3}e_{4}e_{5}e_{60}=e_{2}e_{6}e_{10}e_{30} $

$I_{210}:\qquad e_{1}e_{30}e_{35}e_{42 }+ e_{3}e_{10}e_{14}e_{105} = e_{2}e_{15}e_{21}e_{70} +e_{5}e_{6}e_{7}e_{210}$

$I_{30}:\qquad\ \ e_{1}e_{3}e_{5}e_{15}+ 2e_{2}e_{6}e_{10}e_{30}=e_{1}e_{2}e_{15}e_{30}+ e_{3}e_{5}e_{6}e_{10}  $

For $I_{60}$ and $I_{30}$ the structure is clear at one glance if we write the divisors of $60$ as vertices of a Cayley-like graph (here: 'union' of two cube graphs $Q_3$ with the common face $(263010)$ ):

4                  20

        3  15

    6          30

12                 60


Alternatively if we define   

$a_0:=e_{1} e_{15} \qquad b_0:= e_{3} e_{5} $  

$a_1:=e_{2} e_{30} \qquad b_1:= e_{6} e_{10} $  

$a_2:=e_{4} e_{60} \qquad b_2:= e_{12} e_{20} $  

then   

$I_{60}\iff a_0b_2+b_0a_2=a_1b_1$  

$I_{30}\iff a_0a_1+b_0b_1=a_0b_0+2a_1b_1$.  

For $I_{210}$ the symmetry is a bit less obvious to see. We can identify the divisors of $210$ with the vertices of a tesseract graph $Q_4$ or write the factors of the four products as lines of a matrix and note $a_{ij}a_{4-ij}=210$ as well as the factor $3$ between the two pairs of lines:

  1  30  35  42   
  3  10 105  14   

 70  21   2  15   
210   7   6   5      



  I'd suggest to call identities of this type linear eta product identities. Their linearity seems to enforce a high degree of symmetry in the way these three identities $I_n$ feature the divisors of $n$ which makes them very special among the thousands of known eta product identities. It looks like there is something deeper behind. And: Why do all products have exactly $4$ factors?


So more precisely for naturals $a\ge b$ let's define a linear eta product identity of type $\mathbf{(ab)}$ as an identity $L_1+\cdots+L_a=R_1+\cdots+R_b$ where each $L_i$ and each $R_i$ is a finite product of pairwise different terms of form $\eta(q^{\lambda})$ with $\lambda\in\mathbb N$. (The products $L_i$ and $R_i$ don't need to be all different e.g. the above $I_{30}$ is of type $(32)$ with $L_2=L_3$. But of course we want $\{L_i\}\cap\{R_i\}=\emptyset$ and also that the gcd of all the $\lambda$'s is $1$.)
Somos conjectures that $I_{60}$ is the only linear identity of type $(21)$.


  Is it possible that the three above identities are only the first ones of a whole (infinite?) set of linear eta product identities and/or that for naturals $a\ge b$ there is at most one such identity of type $(ab)$?

Every ultra-power embedding by a measure $\mu$ on a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ is an extender embedding since $\kappa = [id]_{\mu}$ can be the seed for such an embedding and therefore generate $M$ by representing every element as a $j(f)(\kappa)$ for an $f:\kappa \to V$.  Such an infinite cardinal $\kappa$ is of course the critical point of $j$.

Further denote by $g$ the metric on $M$ the volume measure by $d\mu$ and $h$ a metric on $V$. Without hopefully causing too much confusion let $\nabla$ denote both the Levi-Cevita connection on $M$ and a metric compatible connection on $V$. Let the $L^2(V)$ be denoted by $u:M \to V$ such that $u(x) \in V_x$ where $V_x$ is the fibre over $x \in M$ and 
$$ \int_{M} h_x(u(x)u(x))\ d\mu &lt; \infty.$$

Now a few facts. First it is possible to prove that $\nabla$ is a closeable densely defined operator on $L^2(V)$. Thus identify it with its closure and let $\rm{div}=-\nabla^\ast$. Since we assumed that $h$ and $\nabla$ are compatible it is possible to show that for all compactly supported sections $S \in C_c^\infty(T^\ast M \otimes V)$ and $T \in C_c^\infty(V)$ that 

$$(\nabla T S) = (T \rm{tr}\nabla S).$$

Indeed the $(..)$ are exactly what you expect them to be - on the left it is the inner product over ${L^2(T^\ast M \otimes V)}$ and on the right the inner product over ${L^2(V)}$.

It is also possible to show that $\rm{tr}\nabla$ is a closeable densely defined operator. Thus I can define $\tilde{\nabla} = -(\rm{tr}\nabla)^\ast$. We immediately find that:
$$\nabla \subset \tilde{\nabla}\quad\text{and}\quad \rm{tr}\nabla \subset \rm{div}.$$

What I'm interested in is knowing when the closure $\rm{tr}\nabla = \rm{div}$. Equivalently this amounts to showing that $\tilde{\nabla} = \nabla$.

Given such a pair $(L\phi)$ one can easily construct a torsor (as was explained in Milne's book page 125): Zariski locally (say Spec$(A)=U\subseteq X$) one gets a trivialization $\psi: O_U\to L$ using this one gets a global section $e\in \Gamma(UL)$ so $e^{\otimes n}$ is a base of $L^{\otimes n}$. Using the trivialization $\phi: O_U\to L^{\otimes n}$ one gets an element $a\in$$A$ such that $e^{\otimes n}=a\phi(1)$. Then one gets a $\mu_n$ torsor Spec$A[T]/(T^n-a)$ we can patch all these torsors which are constructed Zariski locally together to get a $\mu_n$-torsor on $X$.

How about the converse i.e given a $\mu_n$-torsor $\pi: P\to X$ how can we get such a pair? 

I figured that since $P\times_X P\cong P\times_X\mu_n=$Spec($O_P[T]/(T^n-1)$) one gets a $n$-th roots of unity $a\in \Gamma(P\times_X PO_{P\times_X P})$ by taking the image of $T$.

If this automorphism satisfies cocycle condition $$p_{12}^*(a)p_{23}^*(a)=p_{13}^*(a)\in \Gamma(P\times_XP\times_XPO_{P\times_XP\times_XP})$$ then one can get a line bundle on $X$ using fpqc descent. I think it is true that $a$ satisfies cocycle condition but I have difficulty in verifying this can anyone help me out? Thanks.

I'd like to see if I can use this generalization to find a more ""natural"" (in the colloquial sense of the word) denotational semantics for LLL. At its core is a symmetric monoidal closed category with two functors on it. One of the functors is monoidal and the other is not (well it could be monoidal but then it's a trivial example). There are some other requirements but for the moment I'm mostly curious about how common it is to have non-monoidal functors in the first place.

Question

If you know of an example where someone uses a non-monoidal functor $T$ on a symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathbb{C}$ I'd like to hear about it. If you know of such a $T$ with natural transformations $d_A:TA \to TA\otimes TA$ and $e_A:TA \to 1$ forming comonoids for every object $A$ even better. If the category $\mathbb{C}$ also comes with a monoidal functor $S$ that would be even more fantastic. And if there's a natural transformation $T\Rightarrow S$ then I'll buy you dinner.

I've got examples (fibered phase spaces stratified coherent spaces and locally bounded stratified cliques games and discreet strategies light length spaces) but they're all specifically created for this purpose and I'm curious to see just how natural this kind of construction is.

91717,"By an idempotent semiring I mean a set equipped with a join-semilattice with bottom structure $(0+)$ and a multiplicative monoid $(1\cdot)$ such that the following equations hold:

$a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
$\;\;\;\; (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$
$\;\;\;\; a \cdot 0 = 0 = 0 \cdot a$ 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the category whose objects are the idempotent semirings and whose morphisms are the algebra morphisms i.e. functions preserving the operations. Is there any known concrete characterisation of $\mathcal{A}^{op}$? What about in the case where one restricts to the full subcategory of finitely generated algebras?

Any help much appreciated.

91720,"Hello everyone. I'm about to use a comparison principle that I belive is true but I can't find any precise reference to be sure of it. Here is what I would like to say :
I have a parabolic equation $u_t - Lu = 0$ in $(txy) \in \mathbb R \times \mathbb R \times \omega$ where $\omega$ is a bounded domain.
Note : L has a $0$-order term with unknown sign but I would like to compare with $0$ so this is not a problem.

I have a function $U$ smooth enough (that is $\mathcal C^1$ in time $\mathcal C^2$ in space in the whole closed cylinder $\mathbb R\times \overline\omega$) that verifies :

$U_t - LU \geqslant 0$
$\partial_\nu U = 0$ on $\partial\omega$ (so $\geqslant 0$...)
$U(0xy) \geqslant 0$  

I would like to conclude $U \geqslant 0$.

But every maximum principle I know ""works with Dirichlet conditions"" : $U$ must also be non-negative at any time on the boundary of $\mathbb R\times \omega$. 
In Smoller Shock Waves and Reaction-Diffusion Equations p.93 I found a principle comparison that is almost exactly what I want (far more general in fact because it tolerates nonlinearities and works with mixed conditions) but with $L$ as follows :

$Lu = \sum_{ij = 1}^n (a_{ij}(xt)u_{x_i})_{x_j})$

what is somehow restrictive : in my case the equation is an advection-reaction-diffusion one of the type
$u_t - \Delta u + q(xy)\cdot\nabla u -k(txy)u = 0$
that is not like the one above.

So my question is : does anyone knows about such a comparison principle ? Does the one in Smoller's book extend to more general operators ?

Thank you very much.

91734,"Hi everyone.

I want to optimize certain computation on finite Coxeter groups $(WS)$. Basically I compute the matrices $\rho(T_w)$ for all $w\in W$ of a matrix representation $H\to K^{d\times d}$ of the Hecke algebra $H=\mathcal{H}(WS)$ and do some stuff with these matrices. The representation is given as a list of the matrices $\rho(T_s)$ for $s\in S$. The obvious way to do such a computation is to use the property $l(ws)=l(w)+1 \implies T_{ws}=T_w T_s$ of the standard basis of $H$ to move from layer to layer in the group (""layer"" meaning sets of the form $\lbrace w\in W | l(w)=k\rbrace$ for fixed $k$) and by multiplying the matrices $\rho(T_s)$ to the existing ones.

Since I'm also interested in big examples I quickly run into trouble with my memory in this way because to compute the $\rho(T_w)$ with $l(w)=l$ one has to store all the $\rho(T_y)$ with $l(y)=l-1$ which can be quite a big number if $l$ is around $\frac{1}{2}l_{max}$. Even though I have access to a machine with 128GB RAM this is too much if $W$ and the dimension of $\rho$ are big.

A few days ago I read about Hamilton paths in Cayley graphs. This would solve my memory problem because if I knew a Hamilton path $w_1\ldotsw_n$ I would only need to store the single matrix $\rho(T_{w_i})$ to compute $\rho(T_{w_{i+1}})$ and forget about it afterwards. If I had access to a Hamilton path in the Cayley graph $\Gamma(WS)$ I could carry out my calculations with using only little more memory than I already need for the input itself.

Googling showed my that in general it is not even clear if such hamilton paths always exists. That's rather unfortunate but on the positive side I also found out that there is an easy algorithm in case of the symmetric group and its Coxeter generating set. So I'm hoping that there is a result in the case of Coxeter groups.

So my questions are:


If $(WS)$ is a finite Coxeter system does there exists a Hamilton path in the Cayley graph $\Gamma(WS)$?
If this is indeed the case is there an easy algorithm to traverse a Hamilton path?

This equivalence restricts to an equivalence between locally free sheaves of rank $r$ on $X$ and locally free $f_{*}O_X$-modules of rank $r$ on $Y$ (i.e. rank $rd$ as $O_Y$-modules).

But what about torsion free sheaves or torsion sheaves?

Given a torsion free sheaf $E$ on $X$ then $f_{*}E$ is torsion free on $Y$ and has the structure of a $f_{*}O_X$-module.

In van der Kallen's notes the Borel subgroup is assumed to correspond to the set of positive roots of $T$ in $G$.

Given an element $w \in W$ one has the Bruhat cell $(BwB)/B \subset G/B$ and its closure in $G/B$ is the Schubert variety $X_w$. We also have the boundary $\partial X_w$.

Given a $B$-module $M$ one has an associated $G$-vector bundle $\mathcal{L}(M)$ over $G/B$. We can restrict the vector bundle to the Schubert varietiy $X_w$ and then consider the space $H^0(X_w\mathcal{L}(M))$ of global sections. van der Kallen denotes this space by $H_w(M)$ and calls it a dual Joseph module.

It follows from Remark 2.2.3 and Corollary 2.2.7 in van der Kallen's notes that the functor $H_w(-)$ can be realized as a composition of induction (and restriction) functors $\text{ind}_B^{P_s}(-)$ where $P_s$ is a minimal parabolic subgroup of $G$. Specifically if $w = s_{\alpha_1} s_{\alpha_2} \ldots s_{\alpha_t}$ is a reduced expression for $w$ then

$H_w(-) = \text{ind}_B^{P_1} \circ \text{ind}_B^{P_2} \circ \cdots \circ \text{ind}_B^{P_t}(-)$

where $P_i = P_{\alpha_i}$ is the minimal parabolic corresponding to the simple root $\alpha_i$.

Now to the definitions I am grappling with: Let $\mu \in X(T)$ and let $w \in W$ such that $-w\mu \in X(T)_+$ (i.e. $w\mu$ is an antidominant weight). Then the dual Joseph module $P(\mu)$ is defined by $P(\mu) = H_{w^{-1}}(w\mu) = H^0(X_{w^{-1}}\mathcal{L}(w\mu))$. Assume now that $w$ was chosen to be of minimal length with the property that $-w\mu \in X(T)_+$. Then the minimal relative Schubert module $Q(\mu)$ is defined by

$Q(\mu) = \text{ker}(\text{res}: H^0(X_{w^{-1}}\mathcal{L}(w\mu)) \rightarrow H^0(\partial X_{w^{-1}}\mathcal{L}(w\mu)))$.

So $Q(\mu) \subset P(\mu)$.


  Is there a way to understand $Q(\mu)$ in terms of the homological properties of the
  induction functors $\text{ind}_B^{P_i}(-)$ and their evaluation maps
  $\varepsilon:\text{ind}_B^{P_i}(M) \rightarrow M$ ?


I am not familiar or comfortable at this point with the geometric notions involved in the above definitions but am much more comfortable with the homological properties of the induction functors since these can be defined much more algebraically (say as given in Chapter I.3 of Jantzen's Representations of Algebraic Groups).

91796,"Hi Im trying to understand the proof of the next proposition:

$Proposition.$

If a point $x$ in a locally finite convex cell complex $\Lambda$ lies in the interior of some cell $F$ then there is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $\Lambda$ of the form $int(F)\times N_\varepsilon$ where $int(F)$ is the relative interior of $F$ and $N_\varepsilon$ is an $\varepsilon-$neighbourhood of the cone point in $Cone(Lk(F\Lambda))$. Equivalently there is a neighbourhood of $x$ homeomorphic to the cone on the $k-fold$ suspension of $Lk(F\Lambda)$ where $k=dimF$.

Here $Lk(F\Lambda)$ is the link of $F$ in $\Lambda$.

The idea of the proof is to show that $St(F\Lambda)$ the star of $F$ in $\Lambda$ i.e. the union of all the relative interiors $int(FÂ´)$ where $FÂ´$ is a cell in $\Lambda$ such that $F$ is a face of $FÂ´$ is homeomorphic to $int(F)\times N_\varepsilon$. For this we use that $int(FÂ´)\cong int(F\ast \sigma_{FÂ´})$.

Here $\sigma_{FÂ´}=Lk(FFÂ´)$ and $F\ast\sigma_{F'}$ is the join of the two convex cells.

The book where I'm studying this says that from the homeomorphisms $int(FÂ´)\cong int(F\ast \sigma_{FÂ´})$ it follows that $St(F\Lambda)\cong int(F)\times N_\varepsilon$ but I can't see this.

For the statement of the suspension the book says that if we take a disk neighbourhood in the relative interior of the cell $F$ around $x$ then $D^{k}\times Cone(Lk(F\Lambda))\cong Cone(S^{k-1}\ast Lk(F\Lambda))$. The thing is that I can't see this either.

But do algorithms exist to compute modular exponentiation of the form $a^{\left(2^N\right)}\%m$ faster than with ""classical"" algorithms ?

91898,"Hi.

For a matrix $D \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n}$ and a symmetric positive definite integral even matrix $S \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n}$ put $S[D] := D^TSD$ where the $\cdot^T$ means 'transposed'. Further for a symmetric matrix $X \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n}$ put
$$R(S X) := \{ D \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n} : S[D] = X \}$$

My question is the following: Can one give a more concrete description of the elements in it or can one at least compute this set in an efficient way (for relatively small $n$ say $\leq 20$ or so)? If this is not possible/unknown does it maybe work with

$$R(S X) / GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$$

or something like this? From computations in very small dimensions i got the impression that this set is actually relatively small.

One can show (see for example Koecher/Krieg a german book on modular forms p. 262) that $R(S X)$ is finite and that

$$R(S X) \subset \{ D \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n} : \sum_{ij} |D_{ij}|^2 \leq \alpha(SX) + 1 \}$$

where $\alpha(SX) = Trace(X)/\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is the minimal eigenvalue of $S$ i.e. $\alpha(SX)$ can be easily computed. The problem is of course that the right hand set is pretty big even for dimensions $\leq 20$.

Indeed I think they are so abstracting a little here is my question: given an autoequivalence $T: \mathcal C \rightarrow \mathcal C$ of an arbitrary category $\mathcal C$ is it possible to find a functor $T': \mathcal C \rightarrow \mathcal C$ which is isomorphic to $T$ and is also an automorphism of $\mathcal C$?

91906,"New version of the question:

Given an odd dimensional manifold $V$  an almost contact structure is a pair of $(\alpha \omega)$ where $\alpha$ is a non-vanishing 1-form and $\omega$ is a 2-form whose restriction to $\ker \alpha$ is non-degenerate.  In particular I don't ask that $\omega$ be closed.  From this pair I define a vector field $R$ with the properties that $\alpha(R) = 1$ and $\omega(R \cdot) = 0$. 

A class of examples come from hypersurfaces in a symplectic manifold.  In those examples the 2-form is the restriction of the ambient symplectic form (and is thus closed) and the 1-form is obtained by contracting the symplectic form with a normal vector field.


  Suppose $V$ is a closed manifold.  Can I deform the pair $(\alpha \omega)$ so that the only minimal invariant sets of the resulting vector field are non-degenerate periodic orbits?


More generally does this class of vector fields have any rigidity to it?

Explanation of the change: The first version of this question restricted attention to the class of examples of hypersurfaces in a symplectic manifold.  From what Alvarez Paiva commented it seems unlikely that this is doable.  I am now allowing a larger family of deformations (since the 2-form is allowed to vary among maximally non-degenerate 2-forms dropping the condition of being closed.)

Why I am asking this: I started thinking about this question in trying to understand some examples related to the question of putting a contact structure on an almost contact manifold.  I don't think that my line of thinking is related to the original question anymore but I am still curious to understand how soft almost contact is (compared to contact).

91925,"Short version: I wondering how to simply check if a proposed Markov trace $\phi$ had the correct property using techniques similar to those from the Akutsu-Wadati 1987 paper `Exactly solvable models and new link polynomials. I: N-state vertex models'. The property $\phi(AB)=\phi(BA)$ appears to be simple while I am unaware of a simple and general way to check the other property.

Long version: My question is about constructing a Markov trace associated with a particular solution to the braid equation. For the braid group $B_{n}$ (for $n$ strands with generators $b_{i}$) the Markov trace $\phi$ is required to satisfy two properties:

1) $\phi(AB) = \phi(BA)$ for $AB \in B_{n}$

2) $\phi(Ab_{n}) = \tau\phi(A)$ for $A \in B_{n}$ for some $\tau$ independent of $n$.

Using the Akutsu-Wadati 1987 paper the say that given a representation of the generators $b \rightarrow \tilde{b} \in \mbox{End}(V\otimes V)$ for some vector space $V$ then it is possible to define Markov trace as $\phi(A) = \mbox{Tr}(H\tilde{A})$ ($\tilde{A}$ denotes the representation of the braid word $A$). Tr is the usual matrix trace while $H=h\otimes h \cdots \otimes h$ with $h\in \mbox{End}(V)$. To test the first property one needs merely to check
$$ \left[\tilde{b} h\otimes h\right] = 0. $$

Does anyone know of a simple test for the second condition? I think
$$ \mbox{id} \otimes \mbox{Tr} [\tilde{b} (I_{V} \otimes h)] \propto I_{V} $$
is sufficient but from what I have read this is not true for the Jones polynomial.

If anyone knows of other simple systematic methods for constructing link invariants I would be interested to find out. Also would the procedure generalise if the representation mapped $b \rightarrow \tilde{b} \in \mbox{End}(V\otimes V\otimes V)$

91927,"In what sense is the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection compatible with the operadic composition in the little discs operad and/or the operad of $\overline{M}_{0n}$'s?

Here are (some) details motivation and a more precise question.

The KZ connection $A_n\in\Omega^1(C_n)\otimes\mathfrak{t}^n$ is given by
$$A_n =\sum_{i&lt; j} t^{ij}\d\log(z_i-z_j).$$
Here $C_n$ is the configuration space of $n$ different points in $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathfrak{t}^n$ is the Lie algebra with generators $t^{ij}$ ($1\leq ij\leq n$ $i\neq j$ $t^{ij}=t^{ji}$) and relations $[t^{ij}t^{kl}]=0$ if all $ijkl$ are different and $[t^{ij}t^{ik}+t^{jk}]=0$.

The ""regularized holonomy"" of $A_3$ when $z_1$ stays at $0$ $z_3$ at $1$ and $z_2$ moves from $0$ to $1$ is the KZ Drinfeld associator $\Phi_{KZ}$.

In general an associator $\Phi$ (together with its coupling constant $\mu$) is equivalent to a morphism of operads of groupoids $F:PaB\to T$. Here $PaB_n$ is the groupoid of parenthesized braids and $T_n=\exp \mathfrak{t}^n$ ($\mathfrak{t}^n$'s form an operad of Lie algebras). In the case of $\Phi_{KZ}$ $F_{KZ}$ is given by the ""regularized holonomy"" of $A_n$'s. The natural explanation of the fact that $F_{KZ}$ is a morphism of operads would be that $A$ is compatible with the operad structure. In what sense it is true? (there are two questions - in what sense is $A$ compatible with operad and how it implies that $F_{KZ}$ is a morphism of operads)

I'll mention some random stuff that might appear in the answer but you can ignore it.

There is a flat connection on moduli spaces of rational curves with marked points closely related to $A$. If we define $\hat{\mathfrak{t}}^n$ by imposing one more relation $\sum_i t^{ij}=0$ ($[t^{ij}t^{ik}+t^{jk}]=0$ is then a consequence) the KZ connection descends to $M_{0n}$; let us call it $\hat{A}_n\in\Omega^1(M_{0n})\otimes\hat{\mathfrak{t}}^n$. By putting one of the points to $\infty$ we can identify $M_{0n+1}$ with $C_n/\{az+b\}$ ($a\in\mathbb{C}^*b\in\mathbb{C}$) and via the isomorphism $\hat{\mathfrak{t}}^{n+1}\cong\mathfrak{t}^n/\text{center}$ we can identify $\hat A_{n+1}$ with $A_{n}/\text{center}$. The center of $\mathfrak{t}$ is lost in this way. The Lie algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{t}}^{n}$ form a cyclic operad. The compactified moduli spaces $\overline{M}_{0n}$ also form a cyclic operad.

As $F_{KZ}$ is (modulo the center) given by the parallel transport of $\hat{A}$ between certain tangential base points of $M_{0n+1}\subset\overline{M}_{0n+1}$ I would imagine the operadic compositions to be (roughly) maps
$$M_{0n+1}\times M_{0m+1}\times\text{formal punctured disc}\to M_{0n+m}$$
coming from the operadic composition of $\overline{M}_{0k}$'s. But I'm not sure in what category it would be an operad (of nice families over the punctured discs?) and how to make it technically work (something should be also said about maps of the trivial $\hat T$-bundles over these spaces).

In fact to get a parametrization of the punctured disc it would be better to consider the moduli spaces $M_{0n}'$ of rational curves with $n$ marked points and non-zero tangent vectors at those points.
There is a flat connection on $M_{0n}'$ which sees also the center. Let us replace the relations $\sum_i t^{ij}=0$ with $s^j:=\sum_i t^{ij}\textit{ is central}$. The Lie algebras $\check{\mathfrak{t}}^{n}$ that we obtain in this way still form a cyclic operad and the connection
$$\check{A}_n=  \sum t^{ij}\d\log(z_i-z_j)+ \sum s^i\d\log(v_i)$$
is a flat connection on the configuration space of $n$ different points with chosen non-zero tangent vectors; this 1-form is again $SL(2\mathbb{C})$-basic and so it descends to the moduli space $M_{0n}'$. By putting one of the points to $\infty$ and also normalizing its tangent vector we can identify $M_{0n+1}'$ with $(C_n/\text{translations})\times (\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. We have an isomorphism $\check{\mathfrak{t}}^{n+1}\cong\mathfrak{t}^n\oplus \mathbb{C}^n$ and so $\check{A}_{n+1}$ gets identified with $A_n$ plus a central part corresponding to the tangent vectors. It is the framed version of the KZ connection (and is my favorite).

edit: there is another (Alekseev-Torossian) connection $A^{AT}_n$ on $C_n$ with values is $\mathfrak{t}^n$. $A^{AT}_n$ is in fact on $FM_2(n)$ ($FM_2(n)$ is a compactification of $C_n/\{az+b\}$ where this time $a\in\mathbb{R}_+$). $FM_2(n)$'s form an operad (a version of the little discs operad) and $A^{AT}_n$'s are compatible with the operad structure in the obvious way: if $o_i:FM_2(m)\times FM_2(n)\to FM_2(m+n-1)$ is one of the compositions then $o_i^*A^{AT}_{m+n-1}$ is equal to the connection $A^{AT}_m\oplus A^{AT}_n$ on $FM_2(m)\times FM_2(n)$ after we apply the corresponding $o_i:\mathfrak{t}^m\oplus\mathfrak{t}^n\to\mathfrak{t}^{m+n-1}$. The operad $PaB$ is a sub-operad of the fundamental groupoid of $FM_2$. $\Phi_{AT}$ and $F_{AT}$ are defined as (ordinary not regularized) parallel transport of $A^{AT}$ and $F_{AT}$ is obviously a morphism of operads. I would like to understand the corresponding picture for $A_{KZ}$.

  Suppose we have a corner of a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^d$.  How do we show that we can 'flatten' the surrounding facets into $d-1$ dimensions without overlap?  


What do I mean by that?  Well for the three-dimensional case it means that if you sum the angles around a given vertex of a convex polyhedron you get a sum of less than $2 \pi$.  Here's another way to say that:  

(0) Given a collection of 2-dim cones $C_i$ with angles $a_i$ if the sum of the $a_i$ is greater than $2 \pi$ then $C_i$ cannot be facets of a 3-dim cone. 

(I'm defining a cone to be the convex hull of a collection of rays; so cones are assumed to be convex.)  

And in general dimensions:  

(1) Given a collection of $(d-1)$-dim cones $C_i$ with total $(d-1)$-angle measures $a_i$ if the sum of the $a_i$ is greater than the total angle surrounding a point in $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ then the $C_i$ cannot be facets of a d-dim cone.

This fact can be restated in a lot of other ways.  Maybe one of these is easier to prove?

(2) If a collection of $(d-1)$-dim cones $C_i$ with total $(d-1)$-angle sum greater than the total angle surrounding a point in $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ is configured in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with all cone points set at the origin and every $(d-2)$-face  identified with a $(d-2)$-face of some other cone (i.e. the cones are glued to make a simplicial complex) and if this configuration lies on one side of a hyperplane then the configuration is not convex.

(3) The facets of any d-cone can be isometrically mapped (unfolded!) into a $(d-1)$-hyperplane retaining the coincidence of the cone point and without overlap.

(4) The convex spherical polygon of largest perimeter is a great circle i.e. any spherical polygon with perimeter larger than $2 \pi$ is not convex.

91952,"I'm currently trying to understand the definition of an orbifold as expressed in Thurston's  Geometry and topology of three manifolds (The definition is in chapter 13 p300). I'm confused about the following:

Assume we have a surface $X$ the cover of which includes two open sets $U_a$ and $U_b$ with $U_a \subset U_b$. To $U_a$ we associate the set $\tilde{U}_a \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and let $\Gamma_a$ be an order three rotation acting on $\tilde{U}_a$. Likewise to $U_b$ we associate the set $\tilde{U}_b$ and let $\Gamma_b$ be an order six rotation acting on $\tilde{U}_b$. Assume also that the fixed point of $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_b$ are associated with the same point $x$ in $X$. It seems to me that the these charts are consistent with the conditions laid out in the definition but I'm sure this can't be the case as it would lead to an ambiguity as to whether we have an order three or order six cone point at this point. Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong?

91954,"Symmetric spectra are a particular model for spectra introduced by Hovey Shipley and Smith. They have the nice property that they have a well-behaved smash product. Our interest in spectra comes from homotopy theory and hence we want to define a model category structure on it. Several model category structures are given in Hovey Shipley and Smith. One model category structure that has the stable homotopy category as its homotopy category uses stable equivalences instead of the level equivalences which one might naively guess are a good choice. 

These stable equivalences are supposed to be maps that induce isomorphisms on ""all"" generalized cohomology theories. However they are defined using cohomology with coefficients in a particular class of spectra the injective $\Omega$-spectra. The reason for picking this particular class is given earlier in the article:


  It would be nice if the 0th cohomology group of the symmetric spectrum $X$ with coefficients in the symmetric $\Omega$-spectrum $E$ could be defined as $\pi_0 Map_{Sp^\Sigma}(XE)$ the set of homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $E$. But even though the contravariant functor $E^0 = \pi_0 Map_{Sp^\Sigma}(-E)$ takes simplicial homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms $E^0$ may not take level equivalences to isomorphisms. ... We introduce injective spectra as a class of spectra $E$ for which the functor $E^0$ behaves correctly.


I'm trying to understand this problem and I think it would be helpful to see an example. So my question is: what is an example of a level equivalence $f: X \to Y$ of symmetric spectra and a symmetric $\Omega$-spectrum $E$ such that $f$ does not induce an isomorphism on $E^0$?

Someone who is new to the area and who is not yet interested in the nitty-gritty details of a formal definition can focus on the italicised text perhaps going back to the normal text later for something more concrete.

We say for $E_{n+1}$ denoting a set of $n+1$ entries of $S$. We say an entries set $E_{n+1}$ having a extremal permutation $s_{n^2+1}$ if the very monotone subsequence of length $n+1$ of such $s_{n^2+1}$ is located at this $E_{n+1}$.

This $E_4$ has an extremal permutations $s_{10}=(43276109158)$. The monotone subsequence is $(4321)$ which is located at $E_4=(1238)$.

Observe that if $h(xy)$ has modulus close to one most of the time (for example if $\int \int |h(xy)|\ dx\ dy\approx 1$ or if $h$ has modulus close to 1 in measure) then each of $f$ and $g$ must also have modulus close to one most of the time.

I'd like to know if there's some measurement of ""how close to one in modulus"" each of these functions is to 1 which will yield some form of inequality relating $f$ and $g$ to $h$.  Ideally I'm hoping for some useful function $D$ which measures how close a function is to one in modulus in some sense so that if $D(h)$ is this big or small then $D(f)D(g)$ or $D(f)+D(g)$ is also big or small implying that $f$ and $g$ are also close to one in modulus.

Ideally this inequality would extend to a similar convolution of many functions.  In my particular situation I have that $|\int \int h(xy)\ dx\ dy|$ is close to one which is quite strong and implies that $h$ is close to constant but this doesn't pass to $f$ or $g$ and so I assume I should be looking at something weaker.

  Suppose ${\mathbb R}=\bigcup_n A_n$ where each $A_n$ is countable. Can we further assert that in addition the $\sigma$-algebra the $A_n$ generate is ${\mathcal P}({\mathbb R})$? More precisely can we modify the $A_n$ to a new family $A_n'$ of countable sets with union ${\mathbb R}$ and this generating property?


Asaf's answer shows I'm being (somewhat) sloppy in this formulation. So does it make sense to ask for some intrinsic construction? (Something other than: We start with such and such countable family that generates the Borel sets we code it into bits of the $A_n$ and then we are done. I confess I do not see immediately how to formalize ""intrinsic"" perhaps it makes no sense.)

92053,"EDIT Saturday 11:32 am March 24: a complete answer for $4 + x^2 + y^2$ and generally $4 m^2 + x^2 + y^2$ for fixed $m$ is given in Friedlander and Iwaniec page 282 Theorem 14.8. We might also expect useful stuff in Harman. 

ORIGINAL: There is no inspiration involved with this. It just happened. Well it is about a possible method of giving Joseph some prime spirals. For his birthday. (See ""Primes that are the sum of three squares."")

I do not seem to know whether there are infinitely many primes of the form $1 + x^2 + y^2$ for that matter $4 + x^2 + y^2$ or $9 + x^2 + y^2$ or $16 + x^2 + y^2.$ So that is the question for fixed $a$ are there infinitely many primes $a^2 + x^2 + y^2?$ 

It seems a very good bet. Every prime $p$ not with $p \neq 7 \pmod 8$ can be expressed as $x^2 + y^2 + z^2.$ Furthermore we know that all $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ can be written as $x^2 + y^2$ so that is one example of an infinite set. 

Furthermoremore the count of numbers up to some large $N > 0$ that can be written as $a^2 + x^2 + y^2$ is asymptotically the same as the result with $a=0$ namely 
$$  \frac{0.7642... \; \; N \;}{\sqrt{\log N}}   $$ 

Looking at some computer output it does seem to be very easy to write a bunch of primes with fixed $a$ in $a^2 + x^2 + y^2.$

92061,"Recently a student asked me the following (elementary looking) question :

If $T$ is an invertible linear transformation of some finite-dimensional space $E$ into itself which factorizes as $T = f \circ f $ where $f : E \mapsto E$ is continuous must $T$ have positive determinant ?

Of course this is trivially true if $f$ is itself linear. It is also an easy exercise to show that this also holds when $f$ behaves locally like a linear transformation that is when it is $C^1$ : $T$ then factorizes as $T = df_{f(0)} \circ df_0 $ and since $x \mapsto \det df_x$ keeps a constant sign we're done.

When $f$ is only continuous this certainly still holds but I suspect this requires rather deep properties of continuous maps (unless I missed something obvious ...) with which I'm not very familiar. Hence two questions :

1) Is there an ""elementary"" proof of this ? (in which case I apologize for this question)

2) Does this property sound obvious to experts ? That is is there some two-lines proof of this with a sufficient background ? If yes what would be good references (books for example) to acquire this background ?

92066,"In the classical version of the Cobordism Hypothesis such as e.g. in Jacob Lurie's On the Classification of Topological Field Theories one considers the $\infty$-category of symmetric monoidal functors from the $(\inftyn)$-symmetric monoidal category of (framed) $n$-cobordism to some $(\inftyn)$-symmetric monoidal target category $\mathcal{C}$. One of the first things one proves is that this category of functors is actually an $(\infty0)$-category. For instance if $n=1$ one can take $\mathcal{C}=Vect_k$ and one sees that the datum of a 1-dimensional tqft is the choice of a finite dimensional (i.e. fully dualizable) vector space $V$ so that the datum of a natural transformation between two such tqfts is a morphism of finite dimensional vector spaces $f:V\to W$. These are the data attached to the (oriented) point. Next one looks at what happens for the data attached to 1-dimensional manifolds and sees that $f$ is constrained to be an isomorphism (the quickest test here is to notice that $f$ has to induce an isomorphism between the dimension of $V$ and the dimension of $W$ in the category whose objects are elements of $k$ and whose morphism are only the identities). As this simple example shows what is crucial here is that 1-dimensional manifolds has come into play. This means that if we had restricted our attention to 0-dimensional manifolds instead i.e. we would have considered a symmetric monoidal functor from the then we symmetric monoidal $(\infty0)$-category of 0-dimensional cobordims to the symmetric monoidal $(\infty1)$-category of vector spaces over $k$ we would have had complete freedom in the choice of $f$.

This suggests that in general $n$-dimensional cobordism ""eats"" $n$ non-invertible levels in the target so that the $\infty$-category of of symmetric monoidal functors from the $(\inftyn)$-symmetric monoidal category of (framed) $n$-cobordism to some $(\inftyn+k)$-symmetric monoidal target category $\mathcal{C}$ is actually an $(\inftyk)$-category.

Apart from the interest in this result in itself I'm interested into it for the following possible application to the characters of finite groups: a representation $(V\rho)$ of a finite group $G$ can be seen as a $k$-$k[G]$-bimodule and so as a morphism from $k$ to $k[G]$ in the $(\infty2)$-category of algebras bimodules bimodule morphisms. If this naturally induces a morphism of 1-dimensional tqfts from the tqft $Z_k$ defined by assigning to the point the algebra $k$ and the tqft $Z_{k[G]}$ defined by assigning to the point the algebra $k[G]$ then we would also have a natural morphism $\varphi_\rho:Z_k(S^1)\to Z_{k[G]}(S^1)$ i.e. from $k$ to the class functions of $G$. This should be nothing but the trace of $\rho$. 

Is this correct? Is this point of view already expanded in some reference?

The result is a good approximation to a square wave with slight spiky irregularities or ""whiskers"" at the boundaries but broadly speaking a series of plateaus (plateaux?!) of equal height.

I would like a simple numeric method to extract from the data the best fit ""idealized"" characteristics mainly the average plateau height and width and sleeping gap between steps. I suppose deducing the period would be most of what is needed for a start.

This problem is probably only borderline on-topic here if that being near the interface of maths and computer algorithms. Also it is obvious up to a point how one might proceed by dexterous use of averages. But there may be other situations where the wave form is not so simple for example a sloping line instead of a plateau.

So I wondered if there might be a simple but more effective and robust approach than fiddling around with averages. although I probably wouldn't want anything too sophisticated such as Fast Fourier Transforms (if those might be appropriate).

The case without constraints of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$

Denote the element-wise squared vector of $\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}$ as
$$\mathbf{p}^2=[p_1^2\;\ldots\;p_m^2]^\top\mathbf{q}^2=[q_1^2\;\ldots\;q_m^2]^\top$$
then by Jensen's inequality for jointly convex function we have

&amp;=&amp;f\left(\sum_ip_i^2x_i\sum_jq_j^2y_j\right)\\

&amp;=&amp;{\mathbf{p}^2}^\top F\mathbf{q}^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{ij}=f(x_iy_j)$. This provides a general bound for $f\left({\mathbf{p}^2}^\top\mathbf{x}{\mathbf{q}^2}^\top\mathbf{y}\right)$.

Suppose $C=[c_{ij}]_{m\times m}$ is an orthogonal matrix and the element squared matrix of $C$ is
$$C^2=[c_{ij}^2]_{m\times m}$$
then $C^2$ is a doubly stochastic matrix where  $C^2\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}$and ${C^2}^\top\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}$.

The case if with constraint ${\mathbf{q}^2}={C^2}^\top\mathbf{p}^2$

If an additional constraint $\mathbf{q}^2={C^2}^\top\mathbf{p}^2$ is applied so that $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are constrained on a manifold we can substitute the constraint into the inequality above we get the bound
\begin{eqnarray}

&amp;\leq&amp;\sum_ip_i^2f\left(x_i\sum_jc_{ij}^2y_j\right)\\
&amp;\leq&amp;\sum_i\sum_j{p_i^2c_{ij}^2f(x_iy_j)}\\
&amp;=&amp;{\mathbf{p}^2}^\top(F\circ C^2)\mathbf{1}

It is notable that this bound is simpler than the one obtained by substitution and has $\mathbf{p}$ is homogeneous in both sides of the inequality.

What is the case if with constraint $\mathbf{q}=C^\top\mathbf{p}$?

My question is that if the constraint is replaced with $\mathbf{q}=C^\top\mathbf{p}$ could we obtain the bound of $f\left({\mathbf{p}^2}^\top\mathbf{x}{\mathbf{q}^2}^\top\mathbf{y}\right)$ with Jensen's equality?

$$f^m(x)=\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots + k_m=n}a_{k_1}a_{k_2}\cdots a_{k_m}\right)x^n.$$

The number of distinct products appearing in the iterated convolution is the integer partition number $p(n-m)$ so writing the inner sum as 

(1)
$$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots + mj_m=n}s_{n}(j_1j_2...j_m)a^{j_1}_1a^{j_2}_2\cdots a^{j_m}_m$$
the questions arise: 

What is the coefficient sequence of integers $s_{n}(j_1j_2...j_m)$ explicitly? 

What is its combinatorial significance? 

EDIT: The fact that the number of terms in the sum is $p(n-m)$ is perhaps not so obvious but you can reason as follows: note that the largest subscript that can appear in the coefficient of $x^n$ is $n-m+1$ because $n-m+1+(m-1)\times 1=n$. This restricts you to having only those partitions of $n$ whose largest part is $m-n+1$ that is the set of solutions to the diophantine equation

(2)$$ j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m+1)j_{n-m+1}=n.$$
On the other hand since there are a total of $m$ coefficients in each product (counting repetitions) you know that 

(3)$$j_1+j_2+\cdots +j_{n-m+1}=m.$$
Thus subtracting (2) from (1) you get $$j_2+2j_3+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m+1}=n-m$$
the number of distinct solutions to which is the partition number $p(n-m)$. I am trying to think of a better notation for the summation in (1) as I think it is definitely misleading.

EDIT: I should've indexed everything by $+1$ so that (1) becomes
$$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m}=n-m}s(j_1j_2...j_{n-m})a_1^{m-(j_1+\cdots +j_{n-m})}a_2^{j_1}\cdots a_{n-m+1}^{j_{n-m}}.$$

Note that the scalar coefficients $a_i$ and $b_i$ need not be the same but they should be non-zero of course.

Example: The first two identities on the n=14 page both of degree $12$ are 

q14_12_44 = +1*u1^7*u2*u7^3*u14 +7*q*u1^3*u2*u7^7*u14 -1*u2^8*u7^4 -7*q^3*u1^4*u14^8 ;

so both identities are duals of each other.  


  It should be easy to see that an eta product identity (edit: which is not dual to itself) cannot have two (linearly independant) duals. Is that really easy to see?


An eta product identity can also be self-dual e.g. the known linear identities mentioned in my recent MO thread or the one equivalent to the well-known theta identity $\theta_3^4(q) = \theta_4^4(q) + \theta_2^4(q)$ which becomes when written in terms of $\eta$'s $$s_2^{24}=s_1^{16}s_4^8 +16s_4^{16}s_1^8 .$$


  This concept of duality seems so logical that I wonder: Has there already been any research on that? Has each eta product identity a dual counterpart unless it is self-dual ?


In the collection mentioned above for $n=22$ there is only one identity listed and that one is not self dual it is even highly asymmetrical. Its dual should have the label x22_19_124. Maybe that one is missing just because the computer search had to stop at some point.


  Given that self-dual identities have a higher degree of symmetry: can they always be expressed in terms of Ramanujan's psi phi and/or chi functions?  


I would think the answer is yes as there are even some not self-dual ones that can be expressed in that way.

Edit concerning the first question: Even this may be trickier than expected. For example there are two self-dual identities labeled q6_14_36a and q6_14_36b. They are:

$s_1^9s_3^{\ }s_6^4 +\ \ 6s_1^4s_2^{\ }s_6^9    +2s_2^9s_3^4s_6^{\ }    -3s_1^{\ }s_2^4s_3^9=0$  

$s_1^9s_3^{\ }s_6^4     +12s_1^4s_2^{\ }s_6^9   -4s_2^9s_3^4s_6^{\ }    +3s_1^{\ }s_2^4s_3^9=0$. 

They contain exactly the same $\eta$-products and so can also be considered as dual to each other (and to linear combinations of them). Moreover by linear combinations we may eliminate any one of the four terms resulting in four 3-term identities with coefficients  

 0  1 -1  1
-1  0 -8  9
 1  8  0 -1
-1 -9  1  0. 


Note that each of those has exactly one dual counterpart again as they come in two dual pairs.

[Proof that I know of: $c(S_n)$ equals the number of unordered integer partitions of n and there exist asymptotic formulas for that which show it to be exponential in $\sqrt{n}$. $|S_n|$ is exponential in $n \log n$. Taking double logs we get roughly $(1/2)\log n$ and $\log n + \log(\log n)$ respectively and the quotient goes to $1/2$.]

Similarly if $GL(nq)$ denotes the general linear group of degree n over a field of q elements then for fixed q:

[Proof that I know of: the number of conjugacy classes can be expressed as a polynomial in q of degree n and the group order is a polynomial in $q$ of degree $n^2$ so we get the result.]

It is not hard to check that a non-trivial line bundle with non-zero global sections can not be a direct summand of a free sheaf. The reason is that being a direct summand of a free sheaf implies that the dual line bundle also has non-zero global sections. But that implies the line bundle is trivial.

92176,"I recently found myself talking about SzemerÃ©di's mathematics and briefly discussed his famous sorting network discovered with Ajtai and KomlÃ³s. Apparently their algorithm is not practical because it takes time $C\log n$ for a fairly large constant $C$ and so in practice it is better to go for an algorithm that takes time say $2(\log n)^2$. I have read that reducing this constant is still an interesting open problem and wondered if there was a good place to find out what the status of this problem is.

The answer may depend on exactly what is required of the algorithm so let me ask a precise question though I may be interested in answers to slightly different but related questions. Let's suppose you have $n=2m$ objects to sort and you want to minimize the number of rounds. In each round you can partition the $n$ objects into $m$ pairs and compare each pair and in between rounds you can do whatever computations you want. [See below -- I've changed my mind about that last point.] The number of rounds you need is of the form $C\log n$ but what is known about the constant $C$? 

If I understand correctly the question I've just asked isn't the usual one since usually one requires more. The idea is that you start with the objects lined up from left to right in an arbitrary order and then at each round you choose some way of partitioning the objects into pairs but in between rounds the only thing you can do is switch the objects in each pair if the larger one is to the left of the smaller. Also the comparisons you do in each round are I think independent of the results of previous rounds. This is called a sorting network.

One other way in which one can vary the question is according to whether you allow randomized algorithms. The case that interests me most is the one where randomness is allowed and so is any amount of computation between rounds. Actually I now realize that that's a bit too generous since it means that we can check every single ordering and see whether it is consistent with the comparisons we have made. So I'd better change what I'm asking. First what is known about the constant $C$ in the best sorting network with randomness allowed? Secondly is the best known constant smaller if you allow ""reasonable"" additional computations to take place between rounds?

92194,"A distance-regular graph (DRG) is in essence a graph $\Gamma$ of diameter $d$ for which there are integers $c_i a_i b_i (0 \le i \le d)$ such that for all vertices $x$ of $\Gamma$ and for all vertices $y$ of distance $i$ from $x$ the number of vertices $z$  adjacent to $y$ and distance $i-1$ from $x$ is $c_i$; the number of vertices $z$ adjacent to $y$ for distance $i$ from $x$ is $a_i$ and the number of $z$ adjacent to $y$ of distance $i+1$ from $x$ is $b_i.$
(See the paragraph on intersection numbers in this Wikipedia article on DRGs.)

For example the Petersen graph is distance-regular of diameter 2.  For the Petersen graph the intersection numbers are $b_0=3 b_1=2; a_1=0 a_2=2; c_1=1 c_2=1.$ 

Two recent research projects (one with undergraduates) have led me to some graphs that satisfy a weaker condition -- they satisfy the conditions above for some but not all vertices $x$.  These graphs are not distance regular but look distance regular with respect to a particular vertex that is the intersection numbers $c_i a_i b_i$ are well-defined for the distributions of vertices of distance $i$ from the special vertex $x.$

For example fix a particular vertex $x_0$ in the Petersen graph and consider the six vertices not adjacent to $x_0$.  These vertices lie on a hexagon a cycle of length six.  Replace that hexagon by two triangles.  This new graph is no longer distance regular but the integers $b_0 ... c_2$ still count distributions of vertices with respect to that special vertex $x_0.$

Question.  Is there a theory of these ""local"" distance-regular graphs?  Do they have a name?  (I think ""locally distance-regular"" is taken?  There are a variety of generalizations of distance-regular graphs; a google search reveals ""almost-"" and ""pseudo-"" but none of those generalizations seem to quite describe my need for a graph which has at least one vertex $x$ with intersection numbers.)

These ""local"" distance-regular graphs are fairly common in the sense that one can deform almost any distance regular graph into one of these ""local"" distance-regular graphs in a manner similar to the way the Petersen graph was deformed above.

I can show that some of the properties of DRGs persist in these generalizations for example the minimal polynomial of the DRG divides the minimal polynomial of the ``deformed"" not-quite-distance-regular graph and so the eigenvalues of the DRG are a subset of the eigenvalues of the not-quite DRG.  In many cases these ""not-quite"" DRGs have few eigenvalues.

where $\otimes_{ii+1}$ means the tensor product over the subring of polynomials invariant under permuting $i$ and $i+1$.  It follows immediately that every Soergel bimodule $M$ has the following properties:

(1) $M$ is free as a left module or as a right module although not necessarily as a bimodule.

(2) $M$ commutes with invariant polynomials in the sense that for every invariant polynomial $p \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1\dotsx_n]$ and $m \in M$ we have
$$

I think they also have the following property:

(3) There is an invariant vector an element $m_0 \in M$ so that

extension in which a special Aronszajn tree $T$ comes to have a cofinal branch must collapse
$\omega_1$ since the branch has size $\omega_1^V$ and will contain
at most one node from each of the antichains witnessing that $T$ is
special. In other words a special Aronszajn tree must remain Aronszajn in any
$\omega_1$-preserving forcing extension and this includes all
c.c.c. extensions. Meanwhile any Aronszajn tree can be forced to
be special and the specializing forcing is c.c.c. and absolute
(consisting of finite partial specializing functions). Thus this
forcing remains c.c.c. in any extension in which $T$ remains
Aronszajn.

Concerning the question


A special Aronszajn tree satisfies the first requirement of the question since we
cannot add a branch to it by c.c.c. forcing but it doesn't
satisfy the second requirement since no $\omega_1$-preserving extension
can add a cofinal branch. So special Aronszajn trees won't work.
A Souslin tree satisfies the second requirement but not the first precisely because it is
itself c.c.c. and adds a branch through itself. So Souslin trees
won't work.


What is needed is a tree that is almost special in the sense that
it remains Aronszajn in every c.c.c. extension but not fully
special in the sense that we can add a cofinal branch by some
(non-c.c.c.) $\omega_1$-preserving forcing.

I am interested in this question in part because the existence of
such a tree $T$ would provide an answer Arthur Fischer's question
on two
versions of absolutely ccc because the forcing $\mathbb{P}$ to specialize $T$ is c.c.c. and would remain
c.c.c. in any c.c.c. extensions since the tree would still be Aronszajn
there but it would not be c.c.c. in the $\omega_1$-preserving
extension in which $T$ gains a cofinal branch.

  Let $K$ be a number field. Is there always a finite extension $L / K$ such that $L$ has class number 1? 


If $K$ has finite class field tower (i.e. the tower of fields $(K_n)_{n \ge 0}$ where $K_0 = K$ and $K_{n+1}$ is the Hilbert class field of $K_n$ eventually terminates) then that solves the problem. But it's a well-known theorem of Golod and Shafarevich that the class field tower of $K$ doesn't terminate if $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field with enough primes ramified.

The textbook my colleague has been using claims that it follows from Golod-Shafarevich that these fields $K$ cannot be embedded in any number field with class number 1 but this implication isn't clear to me. Golod-Shafarevich shows that $K$ has no finite solvable everywhere-unramified extension with class number 1 but that's a much weaker statement isn't it?

Translating this in terms of convergence we have the follwings:

$\forall \epsilon>0 \forall f p_0 = p_0(f\epsilon): \forall p\geq p_0 |M_p(f)-\|f\|_\infty| &lt; \epsilon$

Sankaran P.; Vanchinathan P.: Small resolutions of Schubert varieties and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 31 (1995) no. 3 465-480.

Let $G$ be a complex semisimple algebraic group with Weyl group $W$ and $\tau \leq \lambda$ elements in $W$. For some $\lambda$ they can take resolutions called small and use the fact that the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial $P_{\tau \lambda}(q)$ is equal to the PoincarÃ© polynomial in $q^{1/2}$ of the fibre of $\tau P/P$. The resolutions are constructed as a tower of locally trivial fibrations with fibers being Schubert varieties.

My question concerns the theory behind their computation of the PoincarÃ© polynomial. Let $F_q$ be a finite field with $q$ elements. Then they claim that the value of the polynomial at $q$ is given by the number of rational points of the fibre if the varieties are considered over $F_q$ (all varieties are well defined over any field in this case). Why is this true? I guess this derives from a more general and well known theorem about the PoincarÃ© polynomial and counting points over finite fields.

  Is the 'ideal space' of a ring a standard construction in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry?  If so what's it called and where can I read more about it?


My motivation is to strengthen the analogy between algebraic geometry over groups and classical algebraic geometry.  It would be nice when doing algebraic geometry over groups using the space of marked groups to be able to say 'This is analogous to the foobar widget in classical algebraic geometry.'

To demonstrate that this concept has some use I'll give a very simple application.  But first here are a few basic facts.


$\mathcal{I}(R)$ is compact (because it is a closed subset of $2^R$ which is itself compact by Tychonoff's Theorem) Hausdorff and totally disconnected.
Each point $I\in \mathcal{I}(R)$ is contained in a canonical closed subset

$U_I={J\in \mathcal{I}(R)\mid I\subseteq J }$

(which is in fact isomorphic to $\mathcal{I}(R/I)$).
If $R$ is Noetherian then each $U_I$ is equal to the set of ideals that contain a (finite) generating set for $I$ and hence is open.
The subset of prime ideals in $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is closed: indeed for each pair of non-units $xy$ the subset $N(xy)={x\notin I y\notin I xy\in I}$ is open and the union of these sets is the complement of the set of prime ideals.


Now here's the promised application -  a proof of a well known lemma.

Lemma: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring then there is a finite set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1\ldots\mathfrak{p}_k\subseteq R$ with the property that every prime ideal contains one of the $\mathfrak{p}_i$.

Proof: The set of $U_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for $\mathfrak{p}$ prime is an open cover of the set of prime ideals.  Since the set of prime ideals is compact there is a finite subcover. QED

Thus two such functions are equivalent if they agree on a cofinite subset of $X$; and addition and multiplication are performed by restricting to some cofinite subset on which both functions are defined and then adding or multiplying in the usual way. With the obvious norm $A$ is a pre-C*-algebra with completion $B$. I am interested in the maximal ideal space of $B$.

Here is one way to describe it. Let $Y$ be the absolute of $X$ with the usual map $h: Y\to X$.

I googled a lot and ask some colleagues - seems was not  stated explicitly in literature (although proof is simple) am I wrong ?
So I wrote this observation as ""seems to be new"" in arXiv:1203.5759 page 12 proposition 1.



More details.

Capelli determinant is certain element in the center of universal enveloping of $U(gl_n)$  (Wikipedia on Capelli). The Duflo map allows to construct elements in the center of universal enveloping $U(g)$ of any Lie algebra $g$
from the elements in Poisson center of symmetric algebra $S(g)$. 

Capelli elements in the centers are down-to-earth simple-to-work but somewhat
ad hoc elements on the other hand Duflo map gives general and conceptual way to construct such elements but it is difficult to write down them explicitly in some PBW-basis. The equality between the two elements gives a pleasant conclusion that we have elements which are both easy-to-work and conceptually clear.

Consider $gl_n$ denote by $E_{ij}$ its standard basis - the matrices with zeros everywhere except 1 at position $(ij)$.
Form the following Capelli matrix $C_{ij}$ = $E_{ij}$ i.e. $(ij)$-th element of matrix $C$ is element  $E_{ij} $  of the Lie algebra  $gl_n$.

Rather clearly the element $det(C)$ considered as element of commutative algebra $S(gl_n)$
gives $gl_n$-invariant  element so it means that it belongs to the Poisson center of $S(gl_n)$. 
And so by Duflo's theorem $Duflo(det(C))$ belongs to the center of the $U(gl_n)$.

On the other hand we can consider Capelli determinant.
$det^{column} (C + diag(n-1n-2...10) - (t)Id) $ where calculations are performed in non-commutative algebra $U(gl_n)$ and determinant is defined by the convention that elements from the first column come first second column come second and so on.
It is known that this element is also in the center of the $U(gl_n)$ for any $t$.

The claim is that: $Duflo(det(C)) = det^{column} (C + diag(n-1n-2...10) - (n-1)/2 Id) $.

This seems can be extended to characteristic  polynoms and other simple Lie algebras...





The Duflo map is discussed e.g. here:

Remark.

In his seminal paper on quantization M. Kontsevich generalized the Duflo map
to the quantization of an arbitrary Poisson manifolds - he was able to construct 
isomorphism of commutative algebras Center(Quantization(M))  = PoissonCenter(M).
He showed that the classical Duflo map is the particulat case for $M= g$  here $g$ is Lie algebra with its natural Poisson bracket.

1- The solution of this problem is not so nice many matrices being not diagonalizable. And the set of diagonalizable matrices is neither open nor close in any sense (usual if the field is $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$ Zariski otherwise).

2- Diagonalization is not effective. As a matter of fact we cannot compute explicitely the eigenvalues of an $n\times n$ matrix if $n\ge5$ (Abel plus companion matrix).

3- Diagonalization is not really useful. You don't use it to calculate the exponential or to invert ... What engineers are interested in is often stability of dynamical systems. Thus a good problem is whether the spectrum belongs to either the left half-plane or the unit disk whether there are eigenvalues on the unit circle or with vanishing real part.

I therefore open a discussion in which I am looking for either pro- or con- arguments about teaching diagonalization to engineers.

We write a power of 3 in bits in binary representation as follows.
For example $3=(11)$ $3^2=(1001)$ which means that we let the $k$-th bit from the right be $1$ if the binary representation of this power of 3 contains $2^{k-1}$ and $0$ otherwise.


Prove that the highest power of 3 that has a palindromic binary representation is $3^3 = (11011)$.
Prove that $3 = (11)$ is the only power of 3 with a periodic binary representation (in the sense that it consists of a finite sequence of $1$s and $0$s repeated two or more times like ""$11$"" consists of two repetitions of the bitstring ""$1$"").

92398,"Assume we have a ring $R$ a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$.

How can we determine the group $Hom_R(\mathfrak{m}R/\mathfrak{m})$?

At first i thought this was easy but if $f:\mathfrak{m}\rightarrow R/\mathfrak{m}$ we cannot do things like $f(a)=af(1)=0$ for $a\in \mathfrak{m}$ because $1\notin \mathfrak{m}$. And there are no obvious morphisms from $\mathfrak{m}$ to $R/\mathfrak{m}$

I'm afraid that nothing can be said in this generality. Can we say anything about that group if we know for example the global dimension of $R$ or other invariants of $R$? 

In my case the ring $R$ is given by \begin{pmatrix}A &amp;A \\ (x) &amp;A \end{pmatrix}
where $A=\mathbb{C}[[xy]]$ and the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ is given by
\begin{pmatrix}(xy) &amp;A \\ (x) &amp;A \end{pmatrix}
So that $R/\mathfrak{m}=\mathbb{C}$ and $R$ operates via the upper left entry.

Can we compute the group or its dimension in this case?

According to the comments one should compute $Hom_{R/\mathfrak{m}}(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2R/\mathfrak{m})$ which describes the tangent space of a variety if $R$ is the local ring of a variety. In my example i found that if $a:=(xy)$ then we have that $\mathfrak{m}^2$ is given by: \begin{pmatrix}a^2+(x) &amp;A \\ (x) &amp;A \end{pmatrix} so that $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$ is given by \begin{pmatrix}a/(a^2+(x)) &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp;0 \end{pmatrix} Now $a/(a^2+(x))$ is an $R/a$-vector space of dimension 1 generated by the residue class of $y\in A$. So that $dim_{\mathbb{C}}(Hom_R(\mathfrak{m}R/\mathfrak{m}))=1$ whereas $dim_{\mathbb{C}}(Hom_A(aR/a))=2$.

Is the space $Hom_R(\mathfrak{m}R/\mathfrak{m})$ always some kind of ""tangent space""? Even in the noncommutative case? Or is there no geometric intuition in the noncommutative case?

Apparently it came as a generalization of the Kruskal's theorem that states that there exists no infinite family of rooted ordered trees such that none is a minor of another one. Here rooted ordered means that the tree has a root and that the edges escaping from a vertex are ordered. In other words the trees are assumed to be embedded in the plane and the minor operation has to respect this embedding.

Here comes the question: is Robertson-Seymour theorem true for planar graphs when we add the condition that the minor operation respects the embedding? (i.e. we not only ask $G_i$ to be a minor of $G_j$ as an abstract graph but also as an embedded graph.)

92422,"Question. Suppose that $M$ is a closed connected topological manifold and $G$ is its group of homeomorphisms (with compact-open topology). Does $G$ (as a topological group) uniquely determine $M$? 

One can ask the same question where we regard $G$ as an abstract group (ignoring topology) replace topological category by smooth category (here one can equip $G=Diff(M)$ with a finer structure of a Frechet manifold) varying degree of smoothness dropping compactness assumption recovering $M$ up to homotopy etc. 

I do not know how to answer any of these questions. I do not even know if one can recover the dimension of $M$ from its group of homeomorphisms. In low dimensions or assuming that $M$ has a locally-symmetric Riemannian metric and if $dim(M)$ is given I know few things. For instance among 2-dimensional manifolds one can recover $M$ from $G$ since $G/G_0$ is the mapping class group $Mod(M)$ of $M$ and one can tell the genus of $M$ from maximal rank of free abelian subgroups of $Mod(M)$. Same for say closed hyperbolic manifolds with non-isomorphic isometry groups. However given for instance two closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds $M_1 M_2$ with trivial isometry groups I do not know how to distinguish $M_i$'s by say $Homeo(M_i)$ (the problem reduces to a question about homeomorphism groups of the unit ball commuting with $\pi_1(M_i)$ $i=12$ but I do not see how to solve it).

I can use some elementary approach to prove special case: (i) when $k=2$ according to the explicit formula for $f^{(2)}(z)$ I can prove this claim directly. (ii) when the $\deg p(z) =2 $ according to the partial fraction I can also prove this directly. In general the first approach seems very hard to apply and the second approach can give some information (actually it will give a series of nonlinear relations on the roots of $p(z)$). What I am thinking next is that if we regard this relations as hypersurface i want to show that the intersection of all these surface will only give no solution. But for the lack of the knowledge on this nonlinear part I can not complete the proof. 

(P.S. Since the number of the relations of the roots is much more than the number of the roots which seems forcing the roots to be non existed; and this is exactly the reason why I believe this result to some extent.)

An element $x = k_1g_1+\ldots +k_ng_n \in G$ is equal to the identity iff $k_1f'_1+\ldots +k_nf'_n \in K$  therefore $k_ig_i=e$ iff $k_if'_i \in K$ and $k_if'_i \in K$ iff $a_i |k_i$. So we conclude from this that $|g_i| = a_i$ for $i=1\ldots m$ and $|g_i| = \infty$ for $i = m+1\ldotsn$ and also that $\langle g_i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/a_i\mathbb{Z}$ for $i=1\ldots m$ and $\langle g_i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$ for $i = m+1\ldotsn$. Now I need to show that $G \cong \langle g_1 \rangle \oplus \ldots \oplus \langle g_m \rangle \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{n-m}$ but haven't got a clue how to go about it. I know i must show that the intersection $\langle g_i \rangle \cap \langle g_j \rangle=e$ for $i \not = j$ and that any $x \in G$ can be expressed as $k_1g_1+\ldots +k_ng_n$ (this follows from the fact that the set {$g_1\ldotsg_n$} generates $G$ ?) and that $|G| =|g_i|\ldots|g_n|=a_1\ldots a_n$.

I have only recently been made aware that $S_n$ is a so-called $linear$ symmetric space. Apparently this means the following. The collection of (marked) nondegenerate lattices in $n$-space corresponds to the collection $P_n$ of positive definite $n\times n$ symmetric real matrices. The space $P_n$ forms an open convex cone in $\mathbb{R}^N$ $N=n(n-1)/2$. The unimodular elements in $P_n$ consists precisely of $S_n$. Thus $S_n$ is a hypersurface in the cone $P_n$. More specifically $S_n$ is a 'section' of the cone ie. $S_n$ is homeomorphic to an open ball $B$. The significance is this: taking the closure $\bar{B}$ of the ball gives a compactification. To extend the homeomorphism (if we can) now to the closure gives a compactification of $S_n$. 

But still I do not know what the ''linearity'' of $S_n$ $really$ means.

We use the same notations and assumptions as in Carayol's paper. Take $\gamma\in G'(\mathbb A_f)$ and suppose $\gamma^{-1}$ maps $V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$ to $V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$ then $\exists m\in \mathbb Z_{\geq 1}$ such that $\gamma V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}\subset \frac{1}{m} V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$. And $\exists ! f \in F^{*+}$ s.t $\nu'_1(\gamma)\in f\cdot \hat{\mathbb Z}^{*}$.

Let $(A \tau \theta k)$ be a point in $M'_{K'}$ i.e $k: \hat{T} A \rightarrow
 V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$ a symplectic isomorphism. Thus we can identify $\gamma (V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}})/ V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$ as a subgroup (denoted by $\Lambda$ ) of $A_m$. Then we define $A'=A/{\Lambda}$ which is naturally an abelian variety with $\mathcal O_D$ structure.

Then now we need to define a ""right"" polarization on $A'$.

Shouldn't $\hat{A}=\hat{A'}/{\hat{\Lambda}}$? I'm very confused here.

Besides since we have
$$0\rightarrow A_m/\Lambda \rightarrow A' \rightarrow A \rightarrow 0$$
we can identify $\hat{A'}$ with $\hat{A}/(A_m/\Lambda)^{\wedge}$. Then consider the composition
$$A\xrightarrow{f^{-1}\theta} \hat{A} \rightarrow \hat{A}/(A_m/\Lambda)^{\wedge}=\hat{A'}$$
we can get a ""polarization"" $\theta': A'\rightarrow \hat{A'}$. But since $m$ could be arbitrarily large we could not expect $deg(\theta')=deg(\theta)$. However in this moduli problem I think the degree of the polarization is fixed because of the symplectic isomorphism $\hat{T} A \rightarrow V_{\hat{\mathbb Z}}$? So how could we define a polarization  $\theta'$ of $A'$ such that $deg(\theta')=deg(\theta)$?

Assume that $V$ may be defined by polynomials of degree at most $d$ (or to put it otherwise $V$ is an intersection of hypersurfaces of degree at most $d$). My question is the following: is it also possible to define the irreducible components of $V$ by polynomials of degree at most $d$?

This is true if $V$ is an hypersurface (the irreducible components are defined by the factors of a polynomial defining $V$) so the answer is positive when $n$ is at most 2. I have managed to prove it in a few other cases but not much and I would appreciate any advice.

There exists algorithms to compute the irreducible components. I have checked a few of them but they could let the degree of generators grow. Any algorithm using GrÃ¶bner basis for instance will not fit. For the same reasons trying to prove the results using projections is probably hopeless since they may increase the degree of the generators.

I am not sure how relevant the fact that $k$ is algebraically closed is but I suspect there could be very non-trivial arithmetic issues otherwise even when $V$ is 0-dimensional.
I do not mind to work in the projective space instead of the affine space (it implies the result anyway and makes it easier to deal with degrees).
I do not mind to get the irreducible components only as a set (i.e. the ideal up to a radical).

  Question: Given a general partial differential relation (PDR) like $P(ff'f'')\geq0$ where $f:[01]\to\mathbb R$ is smooth (perhaps also with some extra boundary data e.g. the Taylor Series of $f$ is prescribed both at $0$ and $1$) and a known solution $f_0$ to it is it ever possible to determine whether any other solution $f$ can be deformed to $f_0$ via functions satisfying the PDR?
  
  In other words can one infer if the space of solutions (satisfying the same boundary conditions) is path-connected? Is there some application of the h-principle to answer questions of this type?


Although I would be curious to know any possible answers to the question in the title in general my interest is a very concrete Partial Differential Relation and perhaps this is too simple-minded for MO (if this is the case please notify me and I will delete the question). I am mostly hoping for directions of what techniques exist for problems like this or whether this problem is too general to have an answer. Although I know very little about h-principles it feels like it might have something to do with it...

My specific problem of interest is the PDR $$2ff'\leq (f'')^2$$ where $f:[0\frac\pi2]\to\mathbb R$ must satisfy the boundary conditions $f(0)=0=f(\frac\pi2)$ $f''(0)=2=f''(\frac\pi2)$ and all derivatives of odd order of $f$ vanish at $0$ and $\frac\pi2$. The function $$f_0(t)=4sin^2(t)$$ is a solution of the above with the desired boundary conditions. Given any other such solution $f$ can $f$ be deformed to $f_0$ via other solutions? I.e. is there a continuous path $f_s$ of solutions starting at $f_0$ such that $f_1=f$?



PS. Although I am primarily interested in smooth solutions it seems like if we are talking only about real analytic solutions then the PDR can be seen as countably many inequalities between certain sums of coefficients of the Taylor series at $0$ (that can be considerably simplified using the prescribed vanishing of odd-order terms). Nevertheless given there are infinitely many such inequalities it is not clear to me if one solution (i.e. a sequence $a_k$ of coefficients of the Taylor series) can be deformed to another preserving the desired conditions.

92546,"Hello

I am an undergraduate who wants to learn Knot Floer homology. I was told to start with this   expository paper which was working quite well until I reached the actual definition of the differential. The definition involves counting the holomorphic representatives of $\phi \in \pi_2(xy)$ when $\phi$ satisfies $\mu(\phi) = 1$. 

First of all I do not understand how one might tell if $\mu(\phi) = 1$. The only definition of $\mu$ given in the paper is that it is the ""expected dimension"" of the moduli space of holomorphic representatives. I was wondering what is meant here? I have read other definitions of $\mu$ that define it as the index of an operator and while this may be precise I do not think it is what was intended to be used to work out the simple examples and exercises given in the paper.

Specifically there are quite a few problems for the reader in the paper where a picture of the domain of $\phi$ namely $\mathcal{D}(\phi)$ is given and one is expected to compute $\mu(\phi)$ (see for instance page 17). I was wondering how one might even begin to do this?

For instance one can find a $\phi$ so that $\mathcal{D}(\phi)$ is the annulus given in figure $4$. We are later told in the paper that in this case $\mu(\phi) = 0$. How might one figure something like this out? In other examples $\mu$ is negative how might one see this as well? Since the paper is for a beginner I am hoping there is an answer suitable for a beginner.

To sum up.

In what cases is it possible to just look at $\mathcal{D}(\phi)$ and use the picture to compute $\mu(\phi)$ and how does one go about it? I would be very happy if someone explained any of the examples given in the paper or simply point me to a reference. I feel like I am missing something simple and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Background

This is a philosophical question that affects the practice of mathematics. For example it led to the development of alternatives to Euclidean geometry. There are well documented classical approaches including Platonism formalism and various forms of constructivism and intuitionism. I am posting this as a community Wiki to collect less well known or alternative views and to see how they relate to my own thoughts. This is a question that can never be finally resolved given the necessary incompleteness of any sufficiently powerful mathematical system. Debatable extensions to the foundations of mathematics will always be proposed. However it might be possible to reach consensus on an imprecise philosophical criteria for objective mathematics.

The question is taking on increasing importance today. Solomon Feferman near the end of Does mathematics need new axioms? wrote as follows.


  I am convinced that the Continuum Hypothesis is an inherently vague problem that no new axiom will settle in a convincingly definite way. Moreover I think the Platonistic philosophy of mathematics that is currently claimed to justify set theory and mathematics more generally is thoroughly unsatisfactory and that some other philosophy grounded in inter-subjective human conceptions will have to be sought to explain the apparent objectivity of mathematics.


He adds in a footnote:


  CH is just the most prominent example of many set-theoretical statements that I consider to be inherently vague. Of course one may reason confidently within set theory (e. g. in ZFC) about such statements as if they had a definite meaning.


In contrast Harvey Friedman has created a substantial body of work in which he proves certain arithmetical questions are decidable in ZFC plus certain large cardinal axioms and not decidable in ZFC or even ZFC plus smaller large cardinal axioms.

It can be shown that that completeness of $S$ implies that $K(X)$ is complete w.r.t. $d_H$.

Let $K\subset X$ be compact. Then by definition for any $\varepsilon>0$ the open cover $\lbrace B(x\varepsilon)\colon x\in K\rbrace$ has a finite subcover ($B(x\varepsilon)=\lbrace y\in X\colon d(xy)&lt;\varepsilon\rbrace)$. Therefore there are $x_1\ldots x_n\in X$ and put $F=\lbrace x_1\ldots x_n\rbrace$ such that

In this he states that for $\mathcal{A}$ an idempotent complete (see below) triangulated category $K_{-1}(\mathcal{A}) = 0$ is equivalent to the fact that for any full triangle embedding $\mathcal{A} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ into an idempotent complete triangulated category $\mathcal{B}$ we have that $\mathcal{B}/\mathcal{A}$ is also idempotent complete.

An additive category is said to be idempotent complete (sometimes called Karoubian) if for every idempotent $e: A \rightarrow A \hspace{2pt} e^2 = e$ defines a splitting $A = Im(e)\oplus Ker(e)$.

Then we have the following relation among Dedekind zeta functions:

$$\zeta_L(s) = \frac{ \zeta(s) \zeta_{K_6}(s) }{\zeta_{K_3} (s)}.$$

$$ Ind_{G_L} 1 = 1 + Ind_{G_{K_6}} 1 - Ind_{G_{K_3}} 1$$

between the characters of $S_4$ induced from the trivial characters of the subgroups of $\mathrm{Gal}(\widetilde{L}/\mathbb{Q})$ fixing $G_L$ $G_{K_6}$ $G_{K_3}$ respectively. So essentially this is a calculation in group representation theory.

Background: as discussed in an answer to this question if a variety $X$ is paved by affine spaces then it only has $(pp)$ cohomology and the number of its ${\mathbb F_q}$-points equals $P(q)$ where $P(t)$ is the Poincare polynomial of (compactly supported cohomology of) $X$. Note that the coefficients of $P$ are necessarily non-negative given by the number of affine cells in the paving of a fixed dimension. In the appendix to  this paper N.Katz proves a kind of converse to this statement: if the number of points of $X$ over a finite field is given by a polynomial $P(q)$ of $q$ then this polynomial determines the so-called $E$-polynomial $E(xy)$ of $X$ by the formula $E(xy)=P(xy)$. The $E$-polynomial is a partial Euler characteristic where we remember the weights of (compactly supported) cohomology but not the degrees. 

Of course varieties of the latter type can have odd cohomology; the typical example is $X={\mathbb C}^*$ with point count polynomial $P(q)=q-1$. $X$ of course has odd cohomology. A slighly more complicated example due to N.Katz shows that $X$ can also have non-$(pp)$ cohomology. But in these examples the polynomial $P$ has some negative coefficients. 

Hence the question: can $X$ have positive polynomial count but still some odd cohomology (which cancels in the $E$-polynomial)? Note that $X$ can't be smooth projective since then its cohomology would be pure so any odd cohomology would have to show up in the $E$-polynomial. 

There may of course be a trivial example which I am missing.

Instead of $A(L)$ we can consider:
$$ A := A(L_1) \times \dots \times A(L_n).$$

Question: When is $A$ of interest? For what kinds of geometric lattices $L_i$ is $A$ a natural object of study?

(The rest is just an overview of why I am interested in $A$)

So far I have obtained results concerning maximally independent subsets of $A$ of a given cardinality.  A subset $S \subset L$ is maximally independent if $\bigvee S = \hat{1} _L$ and $\forall S' \subsetneq S \bigvee S' \neq \hat{1} _L$. 

Let $r_i$ be the rank of $L_i$ then for any maximally independent $S \subset A(L_i)$ we have that $|S| = r_i$. Likewise let $r = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i$. Then $r$ is the rank of $L$ and for any maximally independent subset $S \subset A(L)$ we have that $|S| = r$.

However if we consider maximally independent subsets $S \subset A$ then it is no longer true that $|S| = r$. Instead we have that $ \text{max}(r_1\dots r_n) \leq |S| \leq r .$

I have managed to obtain a formula for the number of maximally independent subsets of $A$ of a given cardinality $k$ where $\text{max}(r_1\dots r_n) \leq k \leq r $.

If each $L_i$ is just the 2 element poset consisting of $\hat{0} \hat{1}$ then this formula gives the number of minimal $k$-covers of $[n]$.

If each $L_i$ is the subgroup lattice of $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i}^{r_i}$ for distinct primes $p_i$ then the formula gives the number of maximally independent collections of cyclic subgroups of $G := \mathbb{Z}_{p_1}^{r_1} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n}^{r_n}$. Associating each cyclic subgroup with its generator allows us to compute the number of maximally independent subsets of elements of $G$ of a given cardinality.

I was just wondering if there might be other instances where this formula might be applied. The formula is also quite cumbersome at the moment so knowing more about $A$ might help to simplify things a little.

I would like to know how the following game is known in the literature and possibly to have references for related papers.

Description of the game: Fix a space $X$ and two Borel probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over $X$. There are two players $A$ and $B$. They both know $\mu$ and $\nu$. Player $A$ chooses between $\mu$ and $\nu$. Player $B$ can not observe Player $A$'s choice. Say $\mu$ is chosen by $A$. Then an element $x\in X$ is randomly chosen in accordance  with $\mu$. Now player $B$ looking at $x$ must guess the choice of $A$ i.e. Player $B$ must say ""you piked $\mu$"" or ""you picked $\nu$"".  Player $B$ wins if their guess is correct. Player $A$ wins otherwise.

How to formalize the game:


The strategies for Player $A$ can be formalized as (randomized) choices over the two element set i.e. as elements in $[01]$.
A strategy for Player $B$ can be formalized as a map $\sigma: X\rightarrow [01]$: if $x$ is the outcome then guess $\mu$ with probability $\sigma(x)$ and $\nu$ with probability $1-\sigma(x)$. 
Since Player $B$ can not observe Player $A$'s choice the game can be consider as played concurrently.


I believe the game has an optimal equilibrium and its value  is a function of $\displaystyle \bigsqcup_{B\ Borel} | \mu(B) - \nu(B) |$ i.e. of the total variation distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$.

Let $K$ be a nice closed domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for example the closed unit ball. Recall that the Hausdorff distance on the family $C(K)$ of nonempty compact subsets of $K$ is defined as

$$
D(AB) = \inf\{ \delta>0: A\subset B_\delta \text{ and }  B\subset A_\delta \}
$$

where $X_\delta=\{y:\text{dist}(yX)&lt;\delta \}$ is the $\delta$ neighborhood of $X$.

Now consider the restriction of $D$ to the family $A_n$ of real algebraic curves of degree at most $n$ which intersect $K$. Intuitively it seems clear to me that the metric space $(A_nD)$ is finite dimensional in any reasonable sense; for example it should have finite upper box dimension and even be doubling (meaning that a ball of radius $2\delta$ is covered by a uniformly bounded number of balls of radius $\delta$). However so far I've failed to find a proof.

Question: 


  Is the space $(A_nD)$ doubling/of finite box counting dimension? If so what is its Hausdorff/box counting dimension?


Some remarks:


An obvious approach is to estimate the Hausdorff distance in terms of the coefficients but this runs into several problems; for example there are points of non-differentiability at reducible curves and one is lead to estimate the distance to an algebraic curve by evaluating the polynomial (see remark below).
Another natural approach is to fix a large number $N$ (at least $n^2+1$) and consider the map that sends $N$-tuples of points which are at pairwise distances at least $\delta>0$ and which lie on some algebraic curve to the algebraic curve passing through all of them. If this function was Lipschitz or even HÃ¶lder (from the standard metric on $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ to $(A_nd)$) it would follow that the latter is doubling.
This is related to this Mathoverflow question and Åojasiewicz inequality. But since the constant $C$ and the exponent $\alpha$ depend on the curve this doesn't seem to be directly useful.
Of course one may ask this question for more general real algebraic varieties and also for complex varieties; for the latter effective versions of Åojasiewicz inequality such as the one given in this paper of Ji Kollar and Shiffman might help.


Motivation

If $\mathcal{F}$ is a class of curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a tube of width $\delta$ is the $\delta$-neighborhood of a curve in $\mathcal{F}$. A set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is then called tube-null (with respect to $\mathcal{F}$) if for every $\delta>0$ it can be covered by countably many tubes so that the sum of their widths is at most $\delta$.

Together with Ville Suomala we prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is the class of all lines then there are sets of Hausdorff dimension 1 which are not tube-null (this answers a question of Carbery Soria and Vargas). The question arose in trying to generalize this result to the family of algebraic curves of degree at most $n$.

He starts with considering a double complex $C_{\bullet\bullet}$ with $C_{pq}$ to be a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module generated by the maps $\Delta[p]\times\Delta[q]\rightarrow E$ ($E$ is a total space of Serre fibration over $B$) which fit into the diagram

with obvious differentials (coordinate by coordinate differentatials as in normal singular complex).

There are two filtrations he uses the first one (by rows) to determine the homology of the total complex ane the second one to get $E^2_{pq}=H_p(B\underline{H_q}(F)$. I have a problem with the second part. He fixes $p$ and a map $c$ in the bottom row and interprets the diagram as a map $\Delta[q]\rightarrow F_c$ where $F_c$ is the image of $\Delta[p]\times\Delta[q]$ in $E$ such that the diagram commutes which basically means that $C_{pq}=\bigoplus_c \mathbb{Z}[F_c]$ (as a module that's true). Now he calculates the homology of the column and says that it's $\bigoplus_c H_*(F_c)$. Why we can apply the vertical differential here? Do we need to check some compatibility condition?

Next we want to use that $E^1_{pq}$ is a module of singular $p$-chains with coefficients in a local system $\underline{H_q}(F)$ and say that the horizontal differential is just the regular differential to get the desired output. But how do we know that this differential works in a nice way?

I thought it would be good to relate the measure to the integral over the indicator function on the closed ball i.e. write $$\mu\big(B(xr)\big)=\int_X\mathbf{1}_{B(xr)}(y)\ d\mu(y).$$ To do this I need an appropriate sequence to approximate the indicator function:

$$f_x^n(y)=\max\Big(0 \Big[1-n\cdot\mathrm{dist}\big(yB(xr)\big)\Big]\Big)$$

For $x\in X$ and $r>0$ the sequence $f_x^n(y)$ converges pointwise to the indicator function $\mathbf{1}_{B(xr)}(y)$.
$f_{x_m}^n\to f_x^n$ for any sequence $\lbrace x_m\colon m\in\mathbf{N}\rbrace$ with limit $x\in X$.
The mapping $g\colon X\to H(X)\colon x\mapsto B(xr)$ is continuous (w.r.t. the the Hausdorff distance).

92707,"Let $P(x;ab) := {an+b  0\leq n \leq x } $ denote an arithmetic progression. Further let $A(x;ab)$ denote the number of elements of $P(x;ab)$ that are squares.  It's an old conjecture of Rudin that $A(x;ab) \ll x^{1/2}$.  Less ambitiously Erdos posed the problem of showing that $A(x;ab) = o(x)$. This was proven by Szemeredi around 1974 (amusingly the paper is only a few sentences). 

Here is Szemeredi's proof: If the theorem was false then we could find arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions composed of at least $\delta>0$ percent squares. Then invoking the 4 case of Szemeredi's (most well-known) theorem we have that there must be a length 4 arithmetic progression consisting of only squares. However this contradicts an old theorem of Euler. 

While this proof is slick it is natural to want to avoid having to use anything as powerful as Szemeredi's theorem.  I recently I ran across the paper ""On the Number of Squares in an Arithmetic Progression"" by Saburo Uchiyama (Proc. Japan Acad. Volume 52 Number 8 (1976) 431-433.) The complete paper is freely available here.  The paper claims to give a simple and self-contained solution to Erdos' question (that  $A(x;ab) = o(x)$). In fact the proof given is so short that I will repost it in its entirety:



  
    Now I don't follow the claim that ""This clearly proves (1)."" (where (1) is the claim that $A(x;ab) = o(x)$). Certainly when $a=o(x)$ this gives the desired result but why does this work when $a$ is large? 
  


Since this is so short and simple (and I have never seen the argument cited anywere) I am skeptical however perhaps I am missing something obvious. 

(Perhaps it should be pointed out that there is a more recent approach to the problem that yields better quantitative bounds that goes through Falting's theorem due to Bombieri Granville and Pintz.  In fact their analysis shows that the case when $a$ is large compared to $x$ is the `hard case' which raises further suspicion of the above argument.)

The following limit $$\frac{\dim V_{\lambda}}{n!} = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\dim W_{\lambda}}{N^{n}}$$ follows immediately from the well known hook (content) formulas $$\dim V_{\lambda} = \prod_{\square \in \lambda} \frac{n!}{h(\square)} \ \ \ \  \dim W_{\lambda} = \prod_{\square \in \lambda} \frac{N + c(\square)}{h(\square)}$$ which can be found in Macdonald's book.  Notice that $n! = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}[S(n)]$ and $N^n = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} (\mathbb{C}^N)^{\otimes n}$ so what we're seeing is that as $N \rightarrow \infty$ the relative multiplicity of $V_{\lambda}$ in Schur-Weyl duality approaches the relative multiplicity of $V_{\lambda}$ in the regular representation. 

Does anyone have a good feeling for why this is true?

Also let us not forget the Peter-Weyl theorem!

A similar theory is available in the locally compact Hausdorff case by replacing $C(X)$ with the algebra of real-valued functions on $X$ which vanish at infinity. Furthermore these algebras are precisely all the commutative C*-algebras (at least if you take complex-valued functions). Thus if one wishes to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces he might as well study commutative C*-algebras.

Is there an analogous algebraic approach to the theory of ""nice"" metric spaces (e.g. compact locally compact connected etc.)? More specifically is there a natural function space one can attach to every nice metric space which essentially contains all data about the metric space up to isometry?

I'll welcome any references related to this question.

EDIT: Many of the answers referred me to Nik Weaver's (and others') theory of ""Lipschitz algebras"". I took a look at his book and while very interesting (and well written) it doesn't seem to be quite what I am looking for. More specifically it seems that his constructions of Lipschitz algebras only characterize the metric space up to bi-Lipschitz equivalence (which he calls a quasi-isometry) while I'm looking for natural function spaces that would characterize the space up to isometry. His results in section 1.8 of the book show that two (pointed) complete metric spaces have isomorphic Lipschitz function algebras if and only if they are bi-Lipschitz equivalent rather than isometric. He does have a characterization up to isometry (using a different Lipschitz algebra) for the class of metric spaces of diameter less than 2 (section 1.7)  but his reduction of a general metric space (say complete) to a metric space of diameter $\le 2$ is of course far from preserving isometries (rather preserving Lipschitz mappings).

So it seems that I am looking for a somewhat more ""rigid"" construction. Any ideas about that?

My most recent attempt has been to derive the density of $M^*$ (the size of an observation that has also been detected) accordingly :

(If anyone disagrees with me and can articulate a geometric intuition for the Todd genus that would be a reasonable answer.) 

By comparison I do consider the following characterizations of various properties ""geometric"":


The self-intersection number of the diagonal embedding of $X$ into $X \times X$. (the Euler characteristic)
The number of points in which a general linear space of complementary dimension meets $X \subset \mathbb P^n$. (the degree of $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb P^n$)
The genus of the curve $X \cap L$ where $L$ is a general linear space of dimension one greater than $\operatorname{codim} X$. (I don't know of a standard name for this but in a particular sense it is one of the coefficients of the Hilbert polynomial of $X$.)
The maximum number of copies of $S^1$ that can be removed from $X$ without disconnecting it. (the genus of $X$ if $X$ is a smooth curve i.e. Riemann surface)


Note that either the first or the last point gives a geometric characterization for (information equivalent to) the genus of a curve. Without one of these I would not consider the third bullet a ""geometric characterization"" of anything.  In a way this provides part of my motivation for asking this question. Let $L_k$ be a general linear space of dimension $k$ in $\mathbb P^n$. Unless I am mistaken knowing the Hilbert polynomial for $X$ is equivalent to knowing the arithmetic genus of $X \cap L_k$ for every $k \leq n$ such that this intersection is nonempty. Thus a geometric characterization for arithmetic genus would automatically give a geometric characterization for the Hilbert polynomial. (Again in some sense this is already provided by the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch Theorem; but I find this formula so abstracted as to be hardly geometric at all.)

92795,"I am creating a circular neural network with N nodes. Each node is connected via a send pathway to every other node and the connection between two nodes has a weight. Any number sent over the connection deteriorates linearly with the weight.

When a value is received by a node that node takes the value and transmits it along its send paths to the other nodes in the network. Eventually the values deteriorate (at an infinite series). The aim is to find the sum of all the values that pass through a node. Each node takes inputs which are not added to the sum of the values it has received but are simply propagated along the network.

(I apologize in advance. I do not know the math syntax. If someone would be so kind as to edit my post I will review the edits and learn the syntax.)

These weights can be expressed in a two dimensional matrix. In my example there are five nodes and the weights on each of the connections is .5

[[0 .5 .5 .5 .5]
 [.5 0 .5 .5 .5].....[.5 .5 .5 .5 0]]

Rows represent each node and columns represent each target node. A node sending a value to itself sends with a weight of zero (no transmission occurs).

It is possible to represent the output of a node in a generalized form. Assuming node A the output weight of the node (effectively the average of the outputs) is $(1/(N-1))({\rm sum\ of\ outputs})=S_a$ where $N$ is the number of nodes and $S_a$ is Send:A.

Similarly the inputs of the nodes can be expressed as $(1/(N-1))({\rm sum\ of\ outputs})=R_a$ where $R_a$ is Return:A.

The average of all of the other nodes not included in the connections going to A is $(1/(N^2-3N+2))({\rm sum\ of\ others})=F_o$.

For the following equations $M$ is the value of the initial input to a single node in the network.

$M(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (R_a^I)(S_a^I)+(S_a)(R_a)(F_o^I))$ This equals $M((R_aS_a)/(1-R_aS_a) - (S_aR_aF_o)/(F_o-1))$.

This formula will calculate the value that node A receives as a result of node A's propagation. All is fine and well with this sum and it works as it should.

The problem is that this isn't the sum of the values node A has received overall only as a result of node A's input. For instance if a number were sent to both node B and node A then the propagation of the number from B would also add amounts to node A's accumulator.

From the above matrix of weights a new data set can be derived that holds the send receive and other values of each of the nodes.

The goal is this: find a formula or algorithm which when given the inputs to each node and the matrix of weights computes the infinite series for a node and returns its total value.

By measuring the similarity between each node in both subgraphs I can generate a semantic similarity graph see example here: http://graus.nu/thesis/measure-and-visualize-semantic-similarity-between-subgraphs/ (in this case the red and blue nodes are nodes from S1 and S2 the edges represent similarity between nodes).

I thought about taking the shortest path for each node in S1 to each node in S2 and using these to get my avg/mean/std deviation however different sized sets means I miss information in some cases (for example in the case where S1 has 3 nodes and S2 has 8 nodes; I'd get 3 paths). Couldn't I just use all possible edges between all nodes from S1 to all nodes from S2 to get these numbers?

 Question.  Suppose that $p$ is a prime $p-1$ is divisible by $q^2$ for some $q$. Is it true that every number modulo $p$ is a sum of two $q$-th powers. 

If $q=2$ then (*) is true. Indeed in that case $p\equiv 1 \mod 4$. Take any number $t \mod p$. WLOG we can assume that $t$ is odd (the product of two sums of two squares is a sum of two squares). If $t\equiv 1 \mod 4$ then consider the arithmetic progression $4np+t n\ge 0$. By Dirichlet it contains a prime $p'\equiv 1\mod 4$. By Fermat $p'$ is a sum of two squares hence $t$ is a sum of two squares modulo $p$. If $p\equiv -1 \mod 4$ then consider the arithmetic progression $8np+t-2p n\ge 0$. By Dirichlet it contains a prime number $p'$ of the form $4k+1$ (since $p\equiv 1\mod 4$) and we are done. 

That question may be easier than the question cited above. Or it may be a known open problem. 

 Update  Several simplifications of the argument for $q=2$ were proposed. Although the statement is not true when $(p-1)/q^2$ is small it is true when this quotient is large enough. I think this answers my question almost completely. Thanks to everybody who gave an answer or a comment.
